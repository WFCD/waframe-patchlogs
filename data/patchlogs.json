  "changes": "The Sacrifice: Update 23:\nWho would have thought that we’d be launching our third cinematic quest. With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nThe Apostasy Prologue left a memento from the Lotus lingering in the Orbiter, calling back to the moment Ballas extended his hand to her. As they faded beyond grasp, nothing but fragmented transmissions from her remained.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe. Will you unmask the truth in this mind-bending new chapter of the cinematic storyline? THE SACRIFICE will bring you closer to uncovering what has fallen into shadow.\nTHE SACRIFICE Quest is available after completing The Second Dream, The War Within, Chains of Harrow and the Apostasy Prologue, and will be available in your Codex upon login. Bring your best Warframe and Operator loadouts to face the challenges that await you in THE SACRIFICE .\n\nCurrently, we have exactly 131 screens in Warframe that need an artistic pass to the new style. 8 are done and ready to go \nthey're here today! Themes similar to above are coming for the screens we have completed, and all subsequent screens will inherit whatever UI theme you've chosen (default or other purchased themes).\nWe have also have 2 free Themes specifically tailored for our visually impaired and color blind Tenno: the “Equinox Theme” (B&W theme) and the “High Contrast Theme”! We’d love to get your feedback on them so that we can increase Warframe’s accessibility:\n\nTo change your UI theme, go to your Interface Options and select “UI Customization”.\n\nThere you can also change your Background from the 3 available options:\nEquinox Background\nLegacy Background\nVitruvian Background\nYou can also change the UI sounds from the “Legacy” and “Vitruvian” options.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nWarframes with unique Ability-driven (Exalted) Weapons can now be separately Modded in your Arsenal! This includes the ability to customize their appearance too!\nExcalibur/Prime’s Exalted Blade \nWe gave the Blade a partial physical design (hilt) so that you can customize its appearance (Energy color is still determined by Excalibur’s)! \nIvara’s Artemis Bow \nMesa’s Regulators \nIf you own or purchase the Mesa Presidio Skin, you will automatically receive the  Presidio Regulators skin to equip onto Mesa’s Regulators.\nTitania’s Dex Pixia + Diwata\nValkyr/Prime’s Talons\nNo customizing since her Talons’ design is all Energy-based!\nWukong’s Iron Staff\nExalted Weapons work in the following ways:\nThey appear in your Arsenal as an unranked moddable Weapon option once you’ve unlocked the Ability. \nAll Exalted weapons use the Mod classes expected for the class of weapon.\nMelee Exalted Weapons have their Stance Mod permanently displayed in the modding UI with access to Combos!\nTitania’s Dex Pixia now uses Secondary Mods! More on that in the Titania Exalted Weapons Dev Workshop we posted at the beginning of this week.\nWhile Exalted Weapons can be ranked, they do not count towards Mastery Rank (with the exception of Khora’s Venari). \nRiven Mods are not generated for Exalted Weapons.\nLimbo's Stasis has been changed to make it more cooperative! Now, Stasis only stops time for Enemies. Limbo's Gear and all Ally Gear will continue to function. But, because complete time-halting for enemies within the Rift is akin to godly power, the duration of the ability has been shortened overall \nfrom base 30 seconds to 15 seconds. This is of course affected by Mods.\nPlease see our Developer Workshop for more information:\n\n\nThe launch of virtual cursor controls on consoles brought many hotfixes to those platforms with much needed changes and improvements. Our first Dev Workshop looked at bringing D-Pad Functionality, while our second, a follow-up Action Plan, looked at what we planned on improving across platforms. Combined, the following changes are now live for our PC controller players:\nD-Pad support is here!  \nRestored button shortcuts in the Arsenal. \nChanged Relic selection windows to preview content on hover. To choose a Relic, simply select it. \nAdded the ability to auto-rotate your Warframe in the Arsenal (using the Right Trigger) while browsing item grid. \nChanged “preview” and “select” to be independent of one another in the Arsenal item selection (separate bindings displayed in bottom right of screen in Arsenal).\nRemoved the need to hold down and drag in order to select a Mod in the Modding UI. Instead, selecting a Mod will make it stick to your cursor like it used to, allowing you to move it with cursor control or D-Pad. Additionally, hitting “back” will deselect the Mod from your cursor without exiting the screen. \nIncreased the size of Star Chart node hitzones when using a controller.\nFixed category switch with controller LB/RB on some screens when hovering over a category button.\nFixed not being able to fish with Classic Controls.\nFixed LB prompt in Ability Menu appearing permanently after opening fishing gear wheel. \nFixed the cursor on controller moving to an arbitrary spot in the Inventory Sort Options drop down.\nFixed cursor automatically snapping to a button on the right side of the screen if a menu is open.\nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator while customizing with the Right Stick when your cursor is hovering over the item menu.  \nFixed being unable to rotate your Operator at all after fast traveling to the Transference room from “Operator” in the pause menu. \nFixed the “X” callout button missing from the Lunaro Practice Mode, which made it appear that the Practice Mode could not be activated. \nFixed button to send Amp Slots as a gift not actually sending the gift when using a controller. \nFixed controller RB and LB loss of functionality after accessing Navigation, opening matchmaking and then pressing B to back out.\nFixed pause menu button on controller causing a brief UI transition to mouse mode.\nThanks to your feedback, we are continuing our work to improve the cursor experience overall. To stay updated on the changes/fixes we are working on, visit our feedback thread here.\nIncreased Excalibur Prime’s Armor from 250 to 300.\nTeralyst, Gantulyst, and Hydrolyst no longer have regenerated Shields immediately after teleporting from being stuck.\nIncreased Titania’s Diwata damage to 200, Critical Chance to 20% and Critical Multiplier to 2x.\nSlightly lowered the Battalyst and Conculyst's base health from 1300 to 1150.\nSlightly reduced the Battalyst's projectile damage.\nYou can now include “&” in your Zaw weapon Entitling.\nGeneral audio polish for Sanctuary Onslaught.\nFollowing what we started in our previous mainline, we’ve made thousands more micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts, including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.\nAncient and Scorpion grappling hooks no longer go through Gara’s Mass Vitrify wall.\nMoved UI Cursor Sensitivity setting from “Controls” to “Interface”.\nMoved Cetus Wisp and Maprico Tree spawn points a bit further away from water volumes in the NW corner of the Plains for gathering ease.\nAfter the target is captured in Capture missions, the level alert levels will automatically turn off after 1 minute, and enemy spawns will stop after 2 minutes.  \nUpdated the LOC for Banshee’s Sound Quake Augment to “Forgoes channeling to create a shockwave that deals 20x damage at the epicenter, gradually weakening as it expands out\".\nStunning or knocking down Conculysts during their whirlwind ability and Battalysts during their omnidirectional laser ability now cancels the ability. \nRemoved Steam controller icons from the list of selectable sets and swapped them with the Xbox One icons.\nRemoved the “Max Enemy Count Reached” message from Simulacrum enemy selector when first opening it and selecting enemies. It will now only appear when you attempt to spawn enemies and there isn't enough space. It will also no longer clear your previous selection when it happens to be over the limit when you first open it.\nPunch Through Mods no longer affect the Zenith’s Alternate Fire deployable disc.\nGPU particles are now part of melee slam sparks by default.\nIncreased the size of Focus Lens icons to be more on par with the size of Forma, Mastery, and other icons.\nOptimized the Survival HUD slightly. This also fixes problems caused by playing with VSync disabled and joining a mission in progress with a poor network connection.\nUpdated “Show Friend Invite Notifications” in your Gameplay options to “Show Friend Request Notifications” and “Receive Friend Invites From”  to “Receive Friend Requests From”. \nImproved Decoration Placement camera collision.\nUpdated some of the structures in the Corpus Gas City tileset.\nOperator Hoods will appear open and Masks removed when they are involved in a cut scene.\n",

Any damage it receives after that point will target the absorbed health.*\n*Damage absorbed is shown in a buff indicator at the top of the screen.\n*Once all absorbed damage has dispensed, Molt explodes dealing Toxin damage to nearby enemies.\nNow has a 100% guaranteed Viral Status Effect on damage tick. \nIncreased range from 15 meters to 20 meters (at max rank). \nIncreased duration from 3 to 5 seconds.\nMiasma inflicts double damage on targets affected by Spores. \nWhen recasting on the same enemy it will refresh the tick duration and maintain the Viral Status Effect, but will not stun enemies a second time until the Status Effect ticks have subsided.\nIncreased Saryn’s Armor from 175 to 225 (at rank 30)\nIncreased Saryn Prime’s Armor from 225 to 300 (at rank 30) \nMade some minor FX updates to Saryn’s abilities! \nSpores received a slight improvement to the FX.\nReduced the brightness of Miasma.\nImproved FX to make her Molt cast more pronounced.\nSpores have been optimized and will be much nicer to your CPU! \nSaryn is also coming with a whole new set of sounds voiced by [DE]Danielle!! \nAdded Abilities screen stats for Saryn Molt speed buff & duration.\nWe hope you enjoy experimenting with her changes.

Part 2 has arrived, and it brings with it new visuals and a highly anticipated room!\n\nDisappearing platforms!\nDeadly frickin lasers and pressure-pads that you should avoid at all costs!\nDummies you need to kill to complete the course!\nAnd much more!\nAdded 37 Tenno Decorations and 54 Orokin Decorations for your Dojo renovating pleasure!\nAdded new Pigment colors dropped by the following enemies: \nShard Black: Vomvalysts \nTower White: Condrocs \nDevar Grey: Tusk Bombard \nWisp Grey: Skiff Pilot \nMortus Pink: Kuakas\nDid you miss our Dev Workshop!? Read it quickly here \nit's short:\n\nWe have added 'GPU Particles' which replace the no-longer-supported Nvidia PhysX Particles. These GPU Particles can be enjoyed on all Platforms with varying intensity:\nOff/Low/Medium/High... LUDICROUS!\nMany particle FX have been converted, but we will spend some time continuing to upgrade our catalog throughout the year. Our new system is universal, works on almost all GPUs (really old ones might be out of luck), is not locked to a given manufacturer, and is not locked to PC! Console Tenno will receive this next update!\n\nIf you watched Devstream 110, you might already be familiar with our plans to change the Scrambus and Comba. Players can now engage in more cerebral combat with these enemies, using visual cues to take them down:\n\nTheir Nullify aura has been replaced with a power that they can activate in combat. Upon use, it creates an expanding sphere that nuffilies players’ powers, and disrupts them for 2.5 seconds.\n \nSimilar to the way shooting the Nullifier bubble or weak point can interrupt or prevent the aura from spreading, shooting off Scrambus/Comba’s helmet (or killing them) will negate the sphere:\n\n\n\n\nWith today’s update, you are now able to acquire an active Dargyn in the following ways:\nShoot the Pilot, causing the Dargyn to float gracefully to the ground for you to board:\n \nUse Loki’s Switch Teleport on the Pilot, leaving him grounded and confused:\n \nUse a finisher from behind while using Archwing, allowing you to transition from Archwing to Dargyn:\nIn addition to this new mechanic, we have also made the following changes:\nIncreased mounted Dargyn projectile damage from 250 to 450 and increased the clip size from 50 to 75. \nIncreased the spawn frequency of Dargyn patrol and idle Dargyn encounters when roaming the Plains.\n\nImproved Defense Target navigation by shifting the path towards the center of level.\nBuilt additional buildings around the Defense Target path at both Defense locations.\nAdded additional enemy spawn locations for each Defense location, giving AI more of 360 degree attack option.\nAdjusted Turrets within the level.\nAdded additional cover and attack routes for AI.\nThe rail upon which the Defense Tram travels on is now electrified!\nMoved hack panels to easier-to-find places in certain Grineer Shipyard tilesets.

  "changes": "Beasts Of The Sanctuary: Update 22.18.0:\n\nIt’s the postponed Christmas gift that keeps on giving! Revealed back on November 3rd 2017, Khora has finally clawed her way to your screens. From an originally proposed damage deviator to the now metallic Kavat wielding queen of the Strangledome, her time is now. But, she won’t come easily. For Khora and Venari have been detected in Simaris’ Sanctuary, and it’s his rules that are law there.\n\nA balanced Zaw Strike for Nikana and Staff weapons. A steady blade for steady hands.\nA heavy Zaw Strike for Machete and Hammer weapons. Measure twice, strike once... heavily.\nA light Zaw Strike for Scythe or Hammer weapons. Lightweight, for flash and bite.\nA two-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nA one-handed Zaw Grip for measured strikes and greater impact.\nIn the simulated universe of the Sanctuary, my data-immortals have fought each other countless times. Through this violence, I have studied and documented their true character. But my study cannot be complete without the power of the Tenno, the most powerful specimen in the system  — you. Your duty in this experiment is to kill as many specimens as efficiently as possible. In this chaos, the true nature of these creatures will be revealed... as will yours.”\nMust complete The New Strange quest.\nTalk to Cephalon Simaris at his Sanctuary in any Relay OR select Sanctuary Onslaught in the Syndicate World State Window tab.\nEnter the Conduit to the Sanctuary and maintain Efficiency against increasingly difficult Specimens for 2.5 minutes.\nEach Specimen you kill attributes to your overall Efficiency, with Eximus Specimens attributing more. \nEfficiency Stimulus’ are spawned per zone that each grant 10% Efficiency \nuse them wisely!\nEach zone after the first triggers a 45 second Focus Boost that scales in multiplier (MAX of 16x) \nkill Specimens as fast as you can!\nWhen a zone is complete, Simaris will open a Data-Conduit to a new and harder zone within his Sanctuary.\nEach week Simaris simulates a predetermined sequence of tilesets and Elite Specimens. This Onslaught is not for the leisurely, as Specimens are stronger and Simaris’ rewards for your Elite data mimic your efforts. Fight relentlessly and repeatedly until your fingers bleed \nthis please Simaris.\nNo Gear! The Gear wheel, Specters, and Emotes are disabled in Sanctuary Onslaught and Elite. Strictly no Dancing in Simaris' world. \nSimaris demands only Rank 30 Warframes can compete in the Sanctuary.\nAn overuse of Warframe abilities can skew Simaris’ data. You may find he has different tolerance levels against ultimates than first abilities. You may never even encounter this rule, but if you do, know that it is only temporary. \nEach Conduit entered/Zone advanced removes current buffs, active Warframe abilities, combo multipliers, and resets Energy to the respective base level. Harder enemies from a baseline! \nThe amount of Efficiency Stimulus that spawn decreases the deeper you go into the Sanctuary. Simaris is (somewhat) kind and will always spawn at least 1.\nIncrease your pace! The deeper you go into the Sanctuary the faster your Efficiency drops. \nSpecimens do not drop real-world things like Mods/Resources in Simaris’ Sanctuary. Rewards certainly do exist, though. Focus Boons and Reward Tables (below) aplenty! We are also going to introduce a series of rewards once this launch is out \nthere will be more to come!\nLeaderboards are available based on overall score for both Sanctuary Onslaught and Elite Sanctuary Onslaught that Simaris will reset weekly.\n2 Zones = Rotation A\n4 Zones = Rotation A\n6 Zones = Rotation B\n8 Zones = Rotation C\nRemoved Excalibur’s 3 second cooldown on Radial Blind.\nRemoved Weekly Kills Leaderboards and Leaderboard Top 20 placement notification.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.16.0:\nFirst, it's worth mentioning this is largely rooted in improved functionality across the board. We do plan on releasing even more updates soon with further lighting improvements and the 'Build your Own Obstacle Course', so keep checking back for that.\nAnd now, the Remaster!\nWith this Remaster we've aimed to do a few things:\nGive you better decorating tools.\nOffer you more decorations.\nGive you more functionality in the Dojo.\n*Please note that the following items cannot be contributed to the Clan Vault:\nAll Articulas, Displays, and unique items (Neewa's Drawings, etc)\nAmbulas Noggle\nStalker Noggle\nShadow Debt Noggles (Acolytes)\nKuria Statuette\nSacred Vessel\nOro Ornament\nRell’s Donda\nProminence Wisp Totem\nThousand-Year Fish Statuette\nAyatan Sculptures \nwe know many of you enjoy creating monstrous creatures out of Ayatan, but we want to prevent any Endo tears from accidental non-refundable donations. Once everyone familiarizes themselves with this new 'Decorations in the Vault are permanent' we'll loosen this restriction.\nMission type and difficulty level\nPlanet and node\nOpen spots in your squad\nA whole new setting called Controller Interface now allows you to have the option of AutoDetect! AutoDetect will try to detect what you're using, when you use it. So if you prefer the drag-n-drop functionality of the Mods screen, you can keep using a mouse to do that and see the regular keyboard and mouse UI, however, when you next pick up a controller and press a button, the UI will detect that and refresh to show you controller button Icons instead.\nWithin the Controller Interface you can also permanently toggle on/off the controller interface, which forces the UI into either regular (keyboard and mouse) mode, or controller mode (this works separately from auto-detection and Steam Big Picture mode).\nLastly, you can now choose the UI Icon set under the new setting Controller Icon Set. You can choose between XB1, XB 360, PS4, Steam, and AutoDetect (AutoDetect is essentially XB1). However, using a Steam controller will always result in Steam Icons.\nImproved how precisely you can alter the Camera Duration slider (increment by 0.1 when using the arrow buttons next to the slider). This means that the minimum speed for Camera movements is now lower!\nImproved optimization of Advanced Captura Mode.\nThe playing Camera will now stop if you decide to edit a Camera Position while it's playing.\nImprovements for adding/removing Camera Positions while camera is playing in Captura.\nBrilliant/Radiant Shards are not removed from player inventory until the respective Eidolon spawns.\nPlayers can now remove their Shard after inserting it into the Shrine (until the Eidolon spawns, at which point it is removed from their inventories and consumed by the Shrine).\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if a Host migration occurs before the Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if Night ends before the respective Eidolon spawns.\nAll Shards are removed from the Shrine and returned to Player inventories if players extract from that Plains before the Eidolon spawns.\nVomvalysts no longer drop Sentient Cores when they are auto-'killed' at sunrise. Unlike vampires, Vomvalysts are not killed by the sun, they just “go back to where they came from”.\nBased on feedback we are making some changes to the intensity of Visual Effects in Warframe, especially in the context of Eidolon fights!\n\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on numerous Warframe abilities.\nReduced some visual noise/lens flares on the Operator Amp explosions/melee burst.\nGreatly toned down lens flare brightness and durations of Teralyst abilities (and variants)to help with visual clutter.\nImproved handling of rare cases of cache-corruption that would lead to crashes on startup.\nImproved hitbox sizes on the Eidolon Synovias (weak points) to make them easier to hit/target when moving.\nFixed an extra \"0\" damage number popping up for every instance of damage dealt to a Teralyst Synovia. Shotguns will therefore no longer shower the Teralyst with a confetti of zeroes when hitting a weak-point.\nBoltor Prime Status Chance increased from 32% to 34%.\nThe Shard selection screen will now show you how many Brilliant or Radiant Shards you have available to convert into Focus (originally this number would only be available to you once you had selected what Shard type you wanted to convert).\nSpoiler\nOpened arbitrarily locked Void doors/walls that held Rare items. It’s been known for awhile now that the classic combination of Punch Through + Vacuum could grab these items for you, but now it’s open season for all!\nReduced the requirements for \"Kill X Dargyns with a Bow\" Riven challenge to bring the intended difficulty and time commitment in line with other Riven challenges.\nExisting Rivens with this challenge are unaffected\nFish Bait descriptions now also indicate what time of day that the respective fish will spawn. \nSlightly changed the color of each Fishing Spear to better identify which Spear you’re equipping.\nChanged the Fishing Spear Icons in Fisher Hai-Luk’s store to focus more on the Spear tip to better identify each Spear. \nYou can now search for Zaws in your Inventory via their Entitled name.\nUpdated the look of Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead minions to help players better differentiate between them and real enemies.\nUpdated the Verismo Syandana and Boltor Bravura Skin material to appear more metallic (for improved reflections and highlighting) to better match the Octavia Maestra Skin. \nA special UI message is now displayed when picking up a Syndicate Medallion or Cetus Wisp (similar to Argon Crystal). \nYou can now re-open the Ambulas boss doors from the outside if you’re an unlucky Tenno who got locked out of the arena cause your squad initiated the boss fight without you.\nImproved Archwing camera movements to clean up issues of janky jittering. \nRemoved the option to Install a Focus Lens on a Gilded Amp since a Rank 30 Amp is required for that action.\nChanged the Venomous Clip Archwing Mod to reflect the same Cost and Drain of other elemental Mods for Archwing.\nRemoved UI Buff indicators for Focus passives that are active 100% of the time with the exception of Vazarin’s Mending Soul. \nUpdated LOC for the \"Vigilante Fervor\" description to better describe what it does. \nAyatans (with the same type and socket layout) placed as Orbiter Decorations can now be placed back to back as per: https://twitter.com/PabloPoon/status/966762954338250752 \nInfested Ancients will now attempt to attack in more ways than just knockdowns and pulls when you’re within melee range. \nFailed Bounty squads will now be locked to prevent players from joining an already failed Bounty.\nImproved Sky Archwing banking movements to reduce doing so accidentally.\nYou can now shoot while initiating Afterburner in Sky Archwing. \nPlacing in the top 20 in a weekly Leaderboard with at least 50 entries will now show a notification about your placement!\nSentinels and their weapons will now display stats when Chat linked and viewed in the Codex.\nTennoGen items are now linkable in chat! \nNezha Dracun Skin default tints updated to lighten the dark tint and better match workshop images.\nTweaked the Mithra Mirage Skin colors to better reflect the Steam Workshop images.\nUpdated the Sarva Harness textures by request of the creator.\nIncreased the opening speed of doors in the Grineer Sealab tileset. \nRemoved the ability to purchase multiple of the same Helmet/Syandana from the Market. With the changes to how Arcanes are equipped, buying multiple of the same Helmet/Syandana is not necessary. \nUpdated the Vignette Bundle description to indicate it includes 2 Warframe Articulas.\nThe Market previews will now display your current equipped Warframe/Sentinel when viewing Armor Bundles. \nOperator Amps will now display their modular parts in the Operator Customization screen.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Settlement tileset. \nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Sealab Defense tileset.\nImproved AI navigation in the Grineer Galleon Survival tileset.\nImproved AI navigation in the Corpus Ice Planet Defense tileset.\nImproved AI navigation  in the Corpus Outpost Rescue tileset.\nImproved AI navigation and cover techniques in the Lua Defense tileset.\nUpdated all lowercase mentions of ‘Grineer’, ‘Corpus’ and ‘Warframe’ to be uniformly uppercase across the entire game in all languages.\nUpdated the Elite Frontier Lancer Codex image model.\nTweaked the glow FX on the Verismo Syandana. \nIncreased the number of items shown on the ‘Most Used’ list under your Profile & added the ability to scroll the list using your mouse. \nMade slight edits to the Mastery Rank up description so that it reads better.\nIncreased textbox width for Arcane text in Arcane Manager screen.\n",

The Trials lobby is no longer needed!\nIf you need an Arcane refresher, this spoiler is for you!\n\nUpon logging in, all Arcanes installed on Cosmetics/Helmets will be Distilled because Arcanes can no longer be installed on Cosmetics/Helmets.\nOld Legacy Arcane Helmets will keep their Arcane installed but you can not equip the Legacy Arcane Helmet on a Warframe with 2 Arcanes already installed.\nArcanes can only be installed on your Warframe, Operator, Operator Amp, or Zaw.\nYou can install 2 Arcanes per Warframe and per Operator.\nYou can install 1 Arcane on Operator Amps and Zaws.\nYou can now trade Upgraded Arcanes!\nArcanes have received a visual overhaul!

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Hotfix 22.13.3:\nBeam Weapon behavior was originally changed to help with performance but as we've made optimizations to the game over time, we can return them to their original status of hitscan weapons with pinpoint accuracy and zero recoil. Or at least we think we can.\nPerfect accuracy and high fire rate is balanced by limited range and damage ramping up from 10% to 100% over 0.8 seconds when firing and decays back to 10% over 1 second after stopping. To help with ammo economy, Beam Weapons consume 0.5 ammo per trace \nunless they are Flamethrowers.\nOnce this launches (hopefully this week on PC), we're hoping for some practical feedback on the changes and your thoughts! It's a bit tricky to grasp the behaviour changes on paper, but in practice it's something you'll be able to detect quickly. Please bear that in mind when replying \npractical feedback will be the needle mover for any tweaks to come.\nWith such a huge change in behavior, comparing new stats with old is like apples to oranges so they are presented on their own below from our designer:\nBeam weapons now state \"STATUS\" instead of \"STATUS / SEC\" in the Arsenal because they can now Status Effect more than once per second (like all other weapons).\nThe Flux Rifle has a new battery charge up and fully charged sound to go with it’s beam rework!\nMinor tweaks to reload timing on Glaxion and Gammacor.\nTweaked the Synapse beam to better represent it’s Corrosive Damage.\nCurrently Multishot Mods do not increase Status chance.

  "changes": "Shrine Of The Eidolon: Update 22.12.0yup, Another Mainline!:\nTake your fight to the skies by hijacking unmanned Dargyns in the Plains. If you get caught, it's a footrace against the pilot to board the Dargyn! Use these to aid in your search for the new Eidolons!\n\n\n\n“The Sentient was a deformed creature, sent from some dark fold of distant space, crushing towers and citadels across Earth...”\nUntil meeting its fate in a climactic battle.\n“The device detonated. The Sentient's body shuddered, wracked by a cacophonous energy. Fragments of the Sentient crashed to the Plains and marshes and flatlands...”\nThese fragments are known as the Eidolons -\nmysterious titans that continue to wander the Plains and loom over the people of Cetus.\nMost of you have seen the Teralyst, a beast that rises from the watery depths every night. Legends speak of two more Eidolons that fell to the Plains, dormant for centuries but ever-present in the hearts and minds of the Ostrons.\nEidolon Hunters eager to prove their worth are trying to summon these creatures again. Are you worthy, Tenno?\n\nLegends say the Gantulyst wields an enormous boulder for an arm and radiates powerful beams of Sentient energy. The Ostrons built a shrine in its honor hoping to gain its favor.\n\nThe Ostrons believe the Hydrolyst is an omen of impending natural disaster. Stories describe a distinct, pungent aroma that precedes the arrival of this toxic beast.\n\n\nYou now have options to matchmake for Eidolon Hunts!\nIf you’re worthy, you’ll receive a guaranteed Riven Transmuter from the Hydrolyst (if captured). These consumable items can Transmute four Riven Mods into a brand-new Riven. Combining four Rivens of the same type (i.e Rifle, Melee, Shotgun, etc.) will result in a transmuted Riven of that type.\n\n\nEach Warframe’s stats and ability kits combine into a unique entity that offers different strengths and weaknesses. With 34 Warframes to choose from (and the 35th on the way), a Tenno may find there is no challenge they cannot overcome by making good use of the swiss army knife that their Arsenal offers. Some well-rounded frames do multiple things well, while others greatly excel in specific circumstances.\nWhen reviewing the Arsenal over time, our developers often find themselves asking: 'is this fun?’. That's the most important question to us, from the perspective of both the active player and their three squadmates. We understand the importance of power fantasy, but overbearing abilities can make squadmates feel ineffective by seriously disrupting intended gameplay flow. Conversely, when a Warframe doesn’t do enough, players may simply choose a “better” frame, sacrificing personalization and diversity for efficiency. Neither of these situations are ideal, so let’s shake things up!\nIf you've read the Dev Workshop, a lot of this will look familiar, but there are some minor changes! Our intent remains the same. We relist important information here because our Update notes are much more widely read than Dev Workshops.\nWe are revisiting all weapons and adjusting their stats to fit into some Mastery Rank grouping guidelines based on DPS and Crit/Status split total. With this in mind, we are buffing a lot of the weapons you know and love!\nAgain, a lot of this is as shown in the Dev Workshop, but our Update Notes are more widely read.\n\nSadly, not noted here are BEAM weapons \nthey should be ready soon, but we are revisiting them to be more 'like they used to be' in terms of damage instances over time but with a fixed fire rate. Fire Rate mods and their effects are still being determined. The Beam Weapon Category is simply not ready for this Update, but we are still working on it!\n\nConclave Weapon damage rebalancing has been done separately to account for the changes.\n\nWe calculate DPS based on sustained DPS which also takes Critical and Status values into account so our values may be different than yours!\n\nFor those of you in the Riven Market, please be aware these stats will not affect Riven dispositions. Player popularity / usage stats will continue to be the metric for that.\n\nOur data shows enemy weapons are unaffected by this, but if there are cases you believe to be wrong please note them in an appropriate subforum.\nWe sketched out Mastery Rank groupings of 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 for each weapon type with a minimum DPS and amount split between crit and status for each group. Using existing stats, weapons were sorted into the groups. If their stats were too high for their current MR it was raised along with any other properties to match.\nIt's damage places it in MR 10-12 but it's crit and stat split is way too low. MR, status and critical chance is increased to match it's new MR. Increasing status and critical boosts its damage so its reduced down to fit back into the MR group guidelines its original stats dictated\nThe end result is the high performing/popular weapons stats remain untouched outside of being placed into their intended MR group and the rest of the weapons are brought up to equivalency.\n\nProjectile based and low fire rate weapons were given more crit and status allowance when appropriate.\n\nFree weapons like the Dex series have been given Mastery Rank values to match their stats! We know these are grandfathered in inventory regardless of Mastery Rank, it's just for consistency!\n\nSome outliers exist that either don’t meet or exceed their Mastery Rank's allotted DPS and \nCrit/Status split allowance because of additional properties and/or features.\nGrakata \nexceeds Crit/Status split but is extremely inaccurate\nStrun Wraith \nDPS is lower than  its Mastery Rank group but it has forced stagger on hit and high status chance\n\nIf players continue, they earn the credits reward, and the wager target is reset so that they have the opportunity to reach it again for more rewards. If players extract, the game ends and they collect all the rewards they managed to earn. The initial investment fee is only taken away once, regardless of the number of times the reward was earned. If time runs out and players are losing, they forfeit all rewards.\nRequired points per tier are now 50/75/100.\nIncreased the required Index points from 25/50/100 to 50/100/200\nEnemy levels scale half as fast.\nChanged the investment costs from 45k/60k/75k to 30k/40k/50k, and changed the credit returns from 120k/195k/275k to 105k/175k/250k. The amount of profit for each tier remains the same at 75k/135k/200k.\nChanged the rewards to give the total credit return and take away invested credits, instead of combining them into the net profit.\nIncreased Teralyst base level to 50.\nReduced base Armor and reduced base Health of Synovia weak points a bit.\nReduced damage of Teralyst abilities to reflect increased level.\nInverted the Shuffle state to be bright when it's enabled, and dark when disabled.\nResource Drop Chance Boosters now affect Mining and Fishing, doubling the chance to get gems and the base number of fish spawns! (Previously only regular Resource Boosters affected the Plains)\nPrime Vault Bounty Relics in Stage 1 have been moved to be rewarded in Stage 2 and weighted accordingly amongst the other Stages. It’s worth noting that Bounty Stage 5 now yields the highest chance of getting a Vaulted Relic. Our intentions here are to alleviate players abandoning the Bounty after the first Stage.\nResource Theft Incursion and Bounty stage (aka Armored Vault) in Plains now lasts only 2 minutes (was 3 minutes).\nIncreased amount of Lures allowed at once from 6 to 8.

Returning with them are other high-demand Vaulted Prime Accessories and Weapons along with discounted Platinum in four unique packs: the Loki & Ember Dual Prime Pack, the Loki Deception Prime Pack, the Ember Fire Prime Pack, and the Frost Ice Prime Pack: https://www.warframe.com/prime-vault\nEmber Prime, Frost Prime, Loki Prime, Wyrm Prime, Bo Prime, Sicarus Prime, Glaive Prime, Latron Prime, and Reaper Prime Relics have been added as Cetus Bounty rewards for a limited time. You can also find these limited Vaulted Relics in Relic Packs from the Market or as Syndicate rewards.\nThe new Relics are:\nLith G2\nMeso E1\nMeso F3\nNeo F1\nNeo E1\nAxi L1\nAxi S2\nWhy Bounties?\nWe put these Relics in the Bounties not only to change it up, but to also allow for extremely focused Relic acquisition. By having these Relics concentrated in the Bounties, it also leaves the rest of the Star Chart open for placement of new Relics when the next Prime Access begins so you'll have a change of environment while keeping with the same system: hunting Primes.\nRemember, this is a 2 month unvaulting, which means these Relics have 2 months to be acquired. In that time, we will be closely monitoring how reproducible Performance issues may factor into this round and possibly revisit Relic placement. We do want to keep it the same on all Platforms so we'll need a bit of time to make changes.\nAll Bounties reward rotations from tiers 2 to 5 have a Vaulted Relic in it, and be sure to check our droprates site for the latest!\nUpdated textures to the Trinity Knightess Skin at the creator's request.\nImproved the lighting in the Market diorama.\nFollowers (Specters, Rescue Target, etc) no longer cancel charging if they switch targets while using a charging weapon.\n",

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.10.0:\nDisclaimer:\nTenno! This Update brings you yet another Mainline! You may recall from the end of 2017 what that means... it could be a bit bumpy! We're standing by to fix any issues. The major reason for this mainline is that we've done a massive Code audit that touched almost 3000 different core engine files to better optimize Warframe. While this Update brings you some new fashion frame options for Mesa and 3 new Augments, the majority of this Update is focused on bringing fixes and Quality of Life changes. If that's not what you're after, we've got lots of great stuff coming very soon. The Plains are going to get a lot more dangerous at night in an upcoming Update.....\n\nYou can now damage Vay Hek up to 25% of his total Health (was 10% previously) while his Propaganda Drone is active before it shuts off. This will result in less waiting around, and will make Vay Hek in Terra Frame easier to deal with.\nReduced base Armor of Vay Hek in his Terra Frame from 225 to 200.\nGhoul Lore Fragments are simply way more likely to drop within Bounties now.\nGhoul enemies themselves can now also drop the Lore Fragments (and Ghouls always have a chance to appear outside of Ghoul Bounties!).  \nGhoul Bounty tables have received new items including Nitain, Cetus Wisps, and Breath of the Eidolon!\nEquinox's Night-Form 'Mend' now regenerates Shields of Allies as enemies are killed within range.\nIncreased the drop chance of Intact Sentient Cores from Vomvalysts to 100%.\nUpdated description of Kwath (Grip) to properly inform of its stats: \n\"Light weight\" now reads \"Heavy weight\"\n\"increase in speed\" now reads \"increase in damage\"\n\"cost of damage\" now reads \"cost of speed\".\nUpdated the description on Zaw balances to say \"link\" instead of \"counterweight\".\nRemoved the Mastery Rank 2 requirement from the MK1-Furis.\nUpdated the Design Council tips that appear in the loading screen and removed some that don’t apply anymore.\nBounties are now Mastery Rank tiered! In the current system, a player of any Mastery Rank could queue up and join any Bounty, even the highest level ones! In order to avoid a mismatch in experience, we've simply set each Bounty to have a default Mastery Rank. It looks a little something like this: \nWhen the Acolytes are live, players will only see them in the World State panel once they've completed Vor's Prize.\nEidolon Lures now follow both Warframe or Operator rather than just the Warframe. The Lure will also now teleport to the player it’s following if/when it gets too far away/stuck. \nWarframe Specters are now much smarter! If you don't recall, Specters are craftable gear you can equip to summon an AI companion in battle. We've done a general intelligence pass on their proficiency with Weapons, and we've also updated their power-casting logic. Virtually every power is now castable with only a few exceptions! Specters CANNOT cast the following Abilities: Vauban's Minelayer, Ivara's Zipline, Titania's Razorwing, Nekros’ Desecrate and Shadows of the Dead, Excalibur’s Exalted Blade, Valkyr’s Hysteria, Wukong’s Primal Fury, Cloud Walker, and Defy, Atlas’ Petrify and Tectonics, Limbo's entire kit (save for the damage aspect of Banish), and finally Zephyr’s Dive Bomb. \nSecurity cameras now trigger more intelligently, the Corpus have upgraded their software. \nImproved the UI on Defection missions by having instruction text, aligning objectives, and better colour coding for defector icons. \nIncreased duration of Duality Augment to be 10 seconds at Max Rank (affected by Duration Mods).\nSecond Dream now has two vaults instead of three during the first Spy mission.  \nDisabled Stalker, Arc traps, and random transmissions during some quest missions. \nUpdated some doors which still had red non-interactive locked materials to new off versions. \nInstead of redundantly showing both Fire Rate and Charge Rate on bows, they now hide Fire Rate unless comparing to a non-bow weapon. \nChanged the background on selected Tenno customizations to be the same white as when selecting customizations from the Arsenal. \nImproved Sprint/Toggle Sprint so that sprinting stops less often. \nStanding in place with sprint key down no longer causes the sprint posture (for the purposes of Prowl and such).\nWhen a player tries to sell their last Sentinel, a more informative message will appear to explain why it cannot be sold. \nSomachord now continues playing where you left off when you return to your Orbiter.\nSomachord Tones now have their own marker icon when waypointing/finding one in a mission.\nRemoved the \"kill unalerted enemies\" or \"hack 1 terminal\" Challenges from The Law of Retribution and The Jordas Verdict.\nThe War Within Choice Scene has been changed to be untradable.\nTweaked the Cryona Syandana default Tint colors to better match the original Steam Workshop image. \nIncreased the Health of the Loki Specter in the Neptune Junction on Uranus.\nRemoved the equip sound from the Fishing Spear.\nChanged the 'disable sniper scopes' HUD option to be 'use sniper scopes' instead to fit with the positive style of other option wordings.\nIncreased follow radius of Drone in the Drone Hijack Incursion from 30m to 50m.\nLowered health of Grineer Auto Turrets from 1250 to 1100. \nLowered health from 650 to 550 and armor from 100 to 75 of the big Dropship Turret.\nTweaked wording/order in the Landing Craft menu:\nRenamed ‘PLACE DECORATIONS’ to ‘DECORATE’\nRenamed ‘CUSTOMIZE INTERIOR’ to ‘INTERIOR COLORS’\nFlipped the order of those two options\nNox enemies will now react when being damaged by a Stealth attack. Before they would remain not alerted after taking some stealthy damage.\nOperators will now automatically go back into Void Mode after a Void Blast if crouch is still being held (and they have enough Energy).\nReplaced old damaged Liset ship in Vor’s Prize cinematic with new damaged version.\nSabotage missions on Settlement, Shipyards, and Gas City tilesets now have 2 stages.\nThe Arca Plasmor received a change yesterday where headshots no longer deal bonus damage. The Arca Plasmor was designed to hit multiple targets with a high-status chance, but with wide wave projectiles and inherent punch-through, a single shot could result in multiple headshots. With it being a shotgun, it was never intended to behave as a precision weapon, and the bonus pushed it too far out of that mold.\nHowever! While this has changed, headshots should still deal damage (without the multiplier). Currently, there is a bug where headshots deal absolutely 0 damage. This is obviously not intended, and we are working on a fix to resolve this issue.    \nWe apologize for missing this in the original version of the update notes for 22.10.0! As we’ve mentioned before, mainline updates can be a bit rocky (last night’s 4 a.m. ET hotfix for example). Thank you for your understanding.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Leading Blade combo now only hits once during the dash.\nConclave Stance Fateful Truth Sudden Spring combo damage reduced.\n",

  "changes": "Plains Of Eidolon: Update 22.6.0:\nTenno!\nWe’re bringing you what we call a “mainline” update today. This is every fix and QoL change we have been working on since October in addition to content drops. 22.6.0 sets the stage for a bigger end of year Update that includes Khora and more!\nIt’s important to note that sometimes mainline updates can be rocky since they have deep overhauls for optimization within.\nWe will be actively watching for bugs and your feedback on the additions and changes below!\nThe Plains of Eidolon now have changing weather patterns! This new dynamic weather system brings rain, lightning, rolling thunder, as well as fluctuating wind and cloud patterns. The Plains can shift from sunshine to rain (and vice versa) during the day and night, and rain will linger for a reasonable amount of time.\nJumping in puddles isn’t the only good thing about being out in the Plains during the rain! Take advantage of increased fish spawns and reduced visibility for the Grineer while it is raining.\nA rain slider has also been added to the Plains of Eidolon Captura Scene. Adjust the slider from a light trickle to total downpour and capture your dramatic side!\nSince the launch of Focus 2.0 in Update 22: Plains of Eidolon, you have shared your thoughts and suggestions on where we could improve on Operator gameplay as a whole. Focus 2.5 is a reflection of what we’ve learned through your experiences, and acts as a jumping-off point for future implementations that need more consideration before they reach you (daily cap removal for example).\nBelow you will find a breakdown of what has changed in Focus 2.5. If you would like to read more about our intent and motivation for these changes, and some of our future plans for Operator gameplay, head on over to “The Features of Focus 2.5” Dev Workshop thread .\nWe have added shared pool capacity! You can now upgrade your pool size using the points from any School you wish, which increases the maximum capacity for every school all at once.\nYou can increase pool capacity from your active tree. Simply select a School of choice as your “primary” and use its Focus points to increase the shared pool capacity.\nThe ability to increase capacity from within the tree itself still exists, but these points will contribute to the shared pool instead.\nThe costs of unlocking nodes across all trees have, on average, been reduced by almost 30%. The table below compares what a 5 rank passive node (like Zenurik’s Energy Pulse) costs before and after these changes:\n\nVoid Singularity’s pull speed has been doubled.  \nLightning Dash now costs 10 energy per cast.\nGuardian Blast now grants 160 shields at max, up from 100.\nProtective Dash now grants 5s of immunity at max, up from 2s.\nVoid Spines now reflects 100% damage at max, up from 25%.\nStone Skin now adds flat armor, 60 for both Warframe and Operator at max.\nVoid Strike now continues accumulating damage boosts over multiple uses of void mode, each rank adds additional attacks up to a max of 8.\nBlazing Dash now stuns enemies instead of ragdolling.\nWe are excited to see how you feel about these changes, and will be collecting your feedback on Focus 2.5 changes in the dev workshop we posted earlier this week.\nThe following Incursions can now occur in Caves scattered around the Plains: Exterminate, Assassinate, and Cache Recovery. The objectives in these Incursions are the same as they are in the Plains, but there is now a chance for these to randomly take place in caves!\nThe intent of the following changes is to make fishing a more harmonious experience for you and your squad! Until now, Bait, Dye, and Pharoma has only exclusively affected the player who used it. Moving forward, all squadmates will receive benefits from Bait or other fishing consumables in the Plains. The fish you see will still vary from player to player, however, the effects of these consumables will be shared across all members.\nWhen making this change, we also reviewed how each of these consumables worked and tweaked them slightly for the sake of consistency and balance:\nYou can now throw Pharoma and Luminous Dye like Bait!*\nDye, Pharoma and Bait now only work within a certain radius around its casting point. Any player fishing within the radius around this casting point will benefit from its effects.\n*In order for Luminous Dye and Pharoma to work within this system, they are now thrown like bait. They float in the water and affect all fish in the same body of water within a certain radius. This way you can cast out the Dye in one place, and all players will see the fish get highlighted as they swim near it. Multiple Dyes can be used at once, if you want to affect a larger section of the water.\nFinally, we made the following changes and fixes to fishing:\nAdded custom Bait throwing animation.\nActive Bait will no longer be destroyed by fish.\nReduced fish escape speed when spooked.\nFixes towards fish swimming through terrain.\nFixed rare case where fishing Bait would not float properly.\nFixes towards Bait being destroyed if thrown into shallow ponds where the bait would hit the bottom before floating to the surface.\nFixed clients being able to throw one more Bait than they actually have.\nFixed an issue where some fish could swim in the air.\nMass Vitrify is no longer invulnerable and now has sections that break off and explode as it absorbs incoming damage. The amount of damage absorbed scales with Power Strength and Armor. Explosion damage scales with Power Strength. \nMass Vitrify no longer has a duration and remains until recast, destroyed from damage, or smashed with Shattered Lash.\nGara is still relatively new as far as Warframes are concerned but since her release, we’ve found (and many players have found) that an invulnerable and almost impenetrable barrier doesn’t allow for a very engaging gameplay experience. We know that other Warframes also have Powers with similar issues, but adding a shattering component to Mass Vitrify is a change we could easily implement that is consistent with Gara’s glass theme while also making Mass Vitrify more interactive.\nWith these new changes, we can tweak the absorption and explosion values as necessary to make sure Mass Vitrify is both fun and effective. Please keep your feedback constructive and let us know what you think after you’ve had a chance to test these new changes.\nReduced Electric Shield’s Energy Cost per meter to 1 Energy per 4 meters (down from 1 per 1 meter)\nWe previously announced changes to Discharge in this thread. But after further testing, we found that the changes were a lot more powerful than anticipated (we’ve included a video below). As a result, Discharge has not been changed yet. We will continue to work on Discharge improvements before releasing them in a future update. Sorry for getting anyone excited prematurely for Discharge! We appreciate your patience.\nPreviously proposed Discharge changes that ended up with more extreme crowd control than expected \nmodded here for extended range and lower damage. (not live!):\nSpoiler\nReticle will turn blue when targeting allies and red when targeting enemies.\nReticle will show different states for hip, aim and sprint.\nContext actions will dim when aiming while they are active.\nAll non-endless Solar Map and quest missions now display short objective instructions for each stage with a matching marker icon in the UI, similar to those displayed on the Plains.. Some endless missions also have new objective text. \nSimplified and cleaned up any existing objective UI's general alignment, ordering and spacing to make it more readable. \nReworded language in some existing missions’ objective UI for clarity, and added more appropriate text to some timers instead of the generic 'Time'.\nFixed many small consistency issues and bugs with objective markers and replaced some existing mission markers with area markers where appropriate.\nAdded area markers to Hive missions to cover highlight areas where the destroyable tumor nodes spawned around each hive.\nDuring long dialog stages in quests, there will now always be an area marker so that players don't get confused about where they should be.\nChanged timer description in Rescue missions to “Time Limit” instead of “Time Left”. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives locations will no longer disappear for others when someone reaches it first \nit will persist for players who aren't in the area yet. \nIn-world markers for Incursion/Bounty objectives will reappear if you leave the objective area.\nThe countdown timer when leaving the perimeters of an objective in the Plains has moved to a more visible spot in the UI. It also states that you are “abandoning objective”. \nChanged the marker for downed Capture targets from red to a yellow objective marker \nthis will make it clearer to players that they need to use the context action instead of continuing to damage the target.\nObjective timers are now greyed out when paused.\n'Get to extraction' objective appears on the UI when extraction is enabled (excludes missions where extraction is optional).\nExtraction Timer text changed from 'Time:' to 'Extracting In:' so it can't be confused with other active timers.\nSome missions with large extraction zones like landing pads now use a green area extraction marker. Adjusted some extraction zones so that they fill the whole landing pad and marker area, instead of half of a landing pad.\nRemoved panels from Corpus doors which never did anything to avoid new player confusion because they would light up during lockdowns.\nFixed missing markers on Corpus co-op doors.\nThe Rescue Target in the Plains now has a HUD health indicator located under your mini-map.  \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully destroying the Reactor in Sabotage missions.\nFixed Bounty waypoint directing players to extraction when Archwing is immediately deployed upon entering the Plains. \nFixed objective waypoint not disappearing after successfully taking the Vessel from the tomb in the last mission of the Sands of Inaros Quest.\nFixed some Markers being stuck in the at origin on the minimap. \nFixed unlocked icon appearing very dimly on Grineer doors.\nMade performance and memory optimizations to the Plains of Eidolon and other tilesets. If you were experiencing crashes before, we hope that these changes will be the fix!\nThe Corpus Gas City and Grineer Settlement tilesets have received an audio remaster! We revised the sounds in these tiles and used updated engine tech so that certain ambient sounds are more noticeable and clear. The remaster adds more character and personality to the audio and will also make enemies easier to pick out. \nTime between Incursions will increase if you let an Incursion alert expire. The Lotus can take a hint!\nA single Vomvalyst in its energy-form near multiple Lures will now only feed a charge to a single Lure. However, to improve overall survivability of the Lures, we have changed Eidolon Lures to always spawn at level 30 regardless of Bounty level or distance from the gate.\nHunter Command Mod change: your Companion will now focus on an enemy for a set duration when they are first slash proc’d by you. While focused on a target, they will ignore any other newly proc’d enemies and will go back to their default behavior after the duration expires.\nOperators and Ostron Vendors in Cetus have had their eyes beautified with shaders.\nThe beams from Trinity’s Link now fade out when the Ability has ended.\nLephantis’ melee attacks will now knock you back if you’re hit!\nSmoothed NPC movement for clients with a poor connection to host.\nReplaced an old version of the reactor in Grineer Settlement Sabotage with the newer (and fewer-pronged) version used in the Grineer Shipyard Tileset. \nRemoved blue undertone from Nekros Irkalla’s energy wisps.\nImproved AI pathing in the Grineer Asteroid tileset. \nOverall UI optimizations. \nReduced number of stasis mines in Archwing Rush.\nAdded 'destroyable' shine FX to mines in Archwing Rush. \nA Skiff VIP has been added to the list of commanders in Dynamic Assassinate Incursions.\nImproving the responsiveness of loadouts in Relays and Cetus. \nMade improvements towards less hitches in Relays.\nImproved AI pathing on the Grineer Settlement tileset. \nAudio will now properly resume if your audio device is disconnected and then reconnected. \nGrineer Melee enemies on the Plains are now able to climb to the top of the Storage Containers.  \nTuned down the bloom on the wings of the Chroma Vojnik Battle-Damaged Tennogen Skin.\nImproved lighting on the Lua tileset doors. \nChanged “enemies are dead” transmission to “broken their ranks” transmission in Invasion missions. \nUpdated one of Lotus’ lines for the Mastery Rank 25 test to better match the test.\n",

Gold for blood. Blood for gold.\nCetus requires you to earn Standing to unlock rewards from its people. The Daily Standing Cap for Cetus works identically to all other Syndicates, and can be viewed under your Profile!\nAs you venture through Cetus, you will encounter many unique townspeople. Pay close attention to their barks and replies, for each encounter can tell a different story:\nFOSFORs can also be purchased from Nakak! Fosfors do more than just signal your position \nblast these flares into the sky (when equipped in your Gear wheel) for a significantly increased Affinity Range while active!\n\nYou have long dreamed of your perfect blade!

Be sure to view Hok's Other Services to find out how to make your Zaw (and other Melee weapons) your own!\nThe Plains of Eidolon is an ancient battlefield where Sentients fought to destroy the Orokin Tower that the Ostrons now call home. The Sentients failed and died, leaving behind an ancient graveyard throughout the Landscape. The towering Spectral Sentients known as Eidolons survived the Old War. Every night they ascend from the waters and wander the Plains in search of what they’ve lost. Small, deadly Sentients appear throughout the Plains and protect the Eidolon. At daybreak, they disappear and wait for night to emerge once more.\nThe Grineer have organized drilling stations and sprawling outposts throughout the Plains to excavate the technology of the Old War. Fight Grineer during the day and clear out their bases, but be fast as these Grineer will call reinforcements when they spot danger. As you venture deeper into the Plains, there will be tougher Grineer enemies so come prepared. When night falls, some Grineer will retreat to their camps and attempt to wait it out while reinforcing their outposts and repairing their equipment for the new day.\nSaving your Progress on the Plains happens in a number of ways \nmost of which are automatic!\n\nExperience the great outdoors as you fish in the rivers and streams.

There are 3 reusable fishing spear blueprints available for purchase, each specializing in catching specific types of fish:\nHai-Luk also offers Gear to aid in your fishing efforts, and 4 kinds of Bait Blueprints that may be crafted using components from filleted fish and Resources collected in the Plains.\nBefore heading out into the Plains, add your spear of choice to your Gear wheel in your Arsenal. \nFind a body of water, open your Gear wheel (or use your hotkey), and select your spear to enter fishing mode. \nAiming and shooting with the spear works just as it does when launching other spear weapons.\nAim at an unknowing fish and toss your spear for a chance to reel in your catch!\nUse your equipped Bait by pressing the Alt Fire button.\nBy visiting Old Man Suumbaat in Cetus, you can acquire a Cutter to carve resources straight from the rocks of the Plains. Three different reusable Cutter blueprints can be purchased for Standing:\nOnce you have acquired your blueprint and crafted your Cutter, enter the Plains. The ancient battle has left traces of energy on those Plains, and this affects the Landscape, including the very rock formations! As a result, you will be able to mine interesting and strange mineral deposits with interesting and strange rewards. ‘Arcane Gems’ will be available from this system.

Find it and its blueprint in the Market today!\n\nIt's been almost two years since we released the first version of Focus. Focus comes as a system unlocked upon completion of 'The Second Dream'. After answering a series of questions from The Lotus, you (the Operator) chose a Focus school and began your journey through a series of Passives that you needed to unlock all the while earning the Focus points to do so. Then came The War Within, where your Operator became playable with a few abilities meant mainly to help you earn Kuva and participate in Quests.\nThe core purpose of this rework is to shift the goals of the Focus system away from supplementing Warframes and towards making your Operator more combat-ready. This means that there will be more of a balance between Passives and Actives under Focus 2.0.\nLet's start with some very important facts about all your accrued Focus Points and installed Lenses:\nThe Daily Focus Cap has increased from 100,000 to 250,000 Focus per day.\nConvergence Orbs now yield an 8x multiplier versus a 6x.\nNow we shall talk Passives, Residuals, and Actives.\nActives in their current form on the public build are at the behest of a 100 HP pool for the Operator. The Active and Passive Focus paths in Focus 2.0 aim to increase your Operator’s survivability and to give you the option to approach combat with added Operator support and armaments. Only a few encounters will necessitate this and as the game and feedback grows we will develop accordingly.\nAs far as the Focus Schools themselves, we have clear cut the trees of the old system and are rebuilding entirely new ability paths. We are also including cross-Focus nodes you can unlock within different trees!\nMany benefits of the new Focus trees are linked to the activation of the Operator or Operator Abilities (Void Dash, Void Blast, Void Mode).\nWe have reduced the Pool Increase costs significantly and distributed the Focus point investment more into the nodes.\nOperator AMPS: Operator Weapons!\nTenno who seek out the Eidolon Hunter will be exposed to an Operator Weaponry system.\nOperators will be able to wield a new Modular weaponized system that attaches to their arm, called an AMP. These devices amplify the Operator's Void Beam and Void Blast attacks and channeling them in different ways. They are comprised of three components: the Brace, the Scaffold, and the Prism.\nYou can equip and customize your AMP in the Customize Operator menu aboard your Orbiter.\nTake your Captura to new lengths by purchasing the Plains Scene from Old Man Sumbaat! You'll need to climb the ranks of the Cetus Standing to earn this!\nDefection has been added to eligible Void Fissure missions!  \nAdded a new ‘shield-like’ objective marker to Defense, Mobile Defense, Hijack, and Sabotage missions.\nAdded a ‘Delete All Read Messages’ option in the Inbox. *Please note that this currently does not apply to Community messages.\nAdded a Corpus Outpost and Grineer Shipyard tileset level to the Interception mix for some variation. \nAdded a visual indicator when viewing a Mod that lets you know if you already own it. \nPrettied up materials for several doors in different tilesets. \nAdded a Screen-Shake toggle option! \nAdded two new alternate versions of the default Liset load screens!\nYou can now control if you want to accept gifts from All, Friends Only, or None in the Options Menu!\n",
  "changes": "Warframe Update 22: Plains Of Eidolon:\n\nOur biggest update, ever, Plains of Eidolon has finally arrived! First off, thank you for checking it out!\nIf you're new to Warframe \noh hi! You’ve arrived at an interesting time in our multi-year journey. We hope you’ll stay a while and join our little space-ninja community. Cetus and its open landscape, Plains of Eidolon, have been placed early on in the progression path on Earth so that you can experience them as soon as possible!\nIf you’re a Founder \na Veteran \na Prime Access supporter \nplease know that it is by your hand that this crazy update is even possible. This update is dedicated to you.\nPlains of Eidolon, with its expansive landscape and all-new dynamic game systems, represents the ongoing evolution of Warframe. Our continuing mission: to create a game that feels alive, that challenges its creators and its players alike. A game that lives up to the amazing community that has grown around it.\nSome quick facts you might want to know about how Cetus & the Plains of Eidolon work!\nThe Plains of Eidolon and Cetus operate on a persistent asymmetrical Day/Night Cycle. As the sun rises and sets, different gameplay systems become available! The details are:\nThese Update notes have close to 25 pages of information explaining the Update. The Plains of Eidolon is new for all Tenno \ntake your time and enjoy discovering how to make your way through the systems.\nThere are two energy sources for your Operator: 1 for Void Beam, and another for Void Dash, Void Mode, and Void Blast. Both energy sources regen over time, and energy pickups only affect the latter abilities.\n\n\nTo create more flow with Transference between Operator and Warframe, you can now seamlessly transition to your Operator and back to your Warframe at any time \neven when in mid bullet jump! \nYou can now double tap “shift” to perform a slide as the Operator. \nWhen in Operator mode, Warframes now have a 90% damage reduction from enemies if an ability is active during Transference. If no ability is active during Transference, you Warframe is invulnerable and untargetable.\nFor 2 weeks following the Plains of Eidolon, our first ever Twitch Drops Campaign is live!https://www.warframe.com/news/the-great-eidolon-hunt\nEverything you need to know about this campaign can be found in this handy image:\n\nIf you are wondering who to tune into, see here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/849289-twitch-drops-prep-and-exclusive-sigil-drop/\nPlains of Eidolon has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions!\nThe Void has been added to the list of eligible Sortie regions! Sorties that occur in the Void will have every mission take place in the Void. \nModular Melee Rivens have been added to the Sortie Reward Pool! These are different from Melee Rivens in that they are made for Zaw weapon combinations.\nKuva (6000) has been added to Sortie Rewards.\nLenses have been removed from Sortie Rewards \nbasic Lenses have been added to Bounties.\nOne of Warframe’s biggest appeals is the diverse selection of weaponry. Even within the subclasses of rifles and pistols, there is huge variety to be found, such as the distinction between projectile weapons (firing physical projectiles which move through space, like the Boltor) and hitscan weapons (firing draws an imaginary line between the gun and the point aimed at, doing damage instantly to whatever it hits, like the Soma). For obvious reasons, hitscans are very effective at long distances \nthis has never been an issue with Warframe’s tileset-based gameplay, but as we shot enemies from a kilometer away in the plains with our pistols, we knew something had to be done.\n \nWith the release of Plains of Eidolon, most weapons will have a form of damage falloff added, to reduce their effectiveness at extremely long distances. But don’t panic! This damage falloff will only be noticeable at extreme ranges (greater than 300m). Across all of our current tilesets, we were unable to find an unobstructed line of sight longer than 300m, so that is the point at which damage falloff will start.\nReticle sway removed from all zoom levels!\n1 meter punch through added to all snipers without any to start with (snipers with innate punch through unchanged).\n1 combo count removed at a time when duration runs out instead of all of them (decay vs. cooldown).\n1 combo count removed on miss instead of all of them\nAdditional bullets from multishot will each count as their own hits and misses in the combo counter\nCombo duration reduced to 2 seconds for all snipers apart from Lanka which is reduced to 6\nDamage fall off begins at 400 meters and ends at 600 meters with damage reduced to 50% past 600 meters.\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nFirst level zoom reduced from 4x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 10x to 6x\nNext round is chambered immediately after firing instead of waiting for fire rate to cycle\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +10% Damage replaced with +30% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +50% Head Shot Damage\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2.67\nFirst level zoom reduced from 5x to 3.5x\nSecond level zoom reduced from 12x to 6x\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nFire rate increased from 1.5 to 2\nFirst level zoom +15% Damage replaced with +35% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom 15% Damage replaced with +55% Head Shot Damage\nSecond level zoom reduced from 6x to 4x\nThird level zoom 20% Damage replaced with +70% Head Shot Damage\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nCharge rate decreased from 1.5 to 1\nSecond level zoom reduced from 7x to 5x\nThird level zoom reduced from 12x to 8x\nVasto Prime Mastery Rank increased from 0 to 3.\nVasto Prime damage increased from 60 to 70.\nVasto Prime status chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nVasto Prime critical chance increased from 15 to 20%.\nAll trace fire weapons trace distance reduced to 300m apart from Sniper Rifles which stay at 1000m.\nMagnetic Damage Status Effects now drain energy over time as opposed to completely draining all energy. \nChanged Ayatan Star markers to only display if you're within 100 meters or so range of the drop.. Amber Star markers will also appear larger due to their rarity and to avoid confusion. \nMaroo's Bazaar is now located on Mars.\nAdjusted the Nyx Carnifex Helmet and Skin colors to match original design. \nToned down the density of the Zenistars FX.\nRemoved stagger on hit from Grineer Flameblade units.\nCapture missions will no longer have the chance to change to the Exterminate objective in Kuva Siphon missions.\nImproved the mesh quality of the Angstrum and Prisma Angstrum to avoid blocky textures. \nCompanions will no longer lose integrity if a print is in the process of being distilled to prevent unexpected death.\nChanged metal material assignment for ceilings in the Corpus Tilesets to improve performance. \nImproved Corpus Dropship passenger animations and increased the speed at which they drop the Corpus reinforcements. \nCranked down the intensity of Nox’s helmet smash and explosion upon death sound FX.    \nThe following items are now color tintable:\nAll Vandal and Wraith weapons.\nThe Harkonar Wraith Armour and Syandana.\nUpdated icons for the Lato and Braton Vandal.\nImproved Jat Kusar weapon trail so that it is more visible. \nToned down lens flair on Nekros' idle. \nImproved Operator movement animations in the Landing Craft to remove weird leg and arm motions. \nChanged the TennoGen Knaita Mag skin’s default colors to match the Steam Workshop’s main image.

The blueprints will be removed and if they were under construction, the resources and credits will be refunded (except for the argon crystals for The Limbo Theorem, sorry!).\nAnti-MOAs are now able to spawn in Exterminate and Mobile Defense missions on Jupiter.\nTweaked the glass material on the Orokin capsules in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nUpdated Quaro Sugatra’s material rigidness to make it perform more like metal. \nUpdated the Liset’s appearance in the cinematic during the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nCleaned up a small patch of unintended Infestation on the Corpus Outpost tileset. Looks like those Corpus janitors were really slacking!\nThe Gear wheel can now have up to 12 items!\nThe in-game Market now includes a separate category for Warframe Deluxe Bundles! \nThe Ayatan Star installing prompt will now only display once per Ayatan installing session rather than on every socket. \nImproved Hydroid’s Tempest Barrage when aiming through doorways. The Barrage will better hit the aimed location than the actual doorway. \nTweaked the Hydroid Graxx Skin default colors to better match original design.\nReduced the range at which NPCs see ragdolls / projectiles etc \nthis helps reduce the chance an NPC will see a body a long distance away and become alert.\nOptimized scripts used by Defection missions.\nOptimized the Infested Tar Moa sounds. \nMade many small performance optimizations to all Warframe abilities.\nOptimized Coolant Leak Mod slightly. \nRemoved being able to Quick Revive yourself when dueling in the Dojo.\nThe Sharpened Claws Kavat Mod now only applies the Armour debuff when actually dealing damage.

  "additions": "\nIn response to a disturbing transmission from Palladino, the Red Veil Syndicate’s spiritual medium, Tenno are compelled to investigate a dark, mysteriously abandoned Steel Meridian spacecraft found adrift. Inside the vessel, lights flicker and emergency lights strobe. All is quiet except for whispers of “Rap. Tap. Tap,” heard echoing throughout the lifeless craft. What does it all mean? Players must uncover the terrifying reality of what happened onboard, how the Red Veil might play a part in it, and more.\nIf you have completed The War Within Quest and have unlocked the Mot node in the Void the Chains of Harrow Quest will be automatically added to your Codex.\nChains of Harrow Quest is also replayable after completion \nenjoy it all over again!\n\nAlways prepared to sacrifice. This monastic Warframe uses the Void to bolster allies’ defenses and amplify their lethality.\nGet Harrow today by purchasing him in the Market for Platinum, or by completing the Chains of Harrow quest and finding his parts! His parts can be found in the Defection mission type, Grineer Fortress Spy missions, and from enemies corrupted by Void Fissures!\n\nPreviewed in the Operation: Ambulas Reborn, 6 Syndicate Weapon Augments are back and here to stay!\nAvenging Truth\nEntropy Detonation\nStockpiled Blight\nVoltage Sequence\nNeutralizing Justice\nDisarming Purity\nHarrow’s signature Primary weapon, the Scourge is a Corrosive spear gun that shoots wave projectiles with high Punch Through and guaranteed Status Effects. Thrown spears attach a bullet attractor to the heads of all enemies within 14 meters, and continues to pulse every 7 seconds and attaches bullet attractors for 3 seconds wherever it has landed.\nHarrow’s signature Secondary weapon, the Knell, has the utility of a sniper with the sight and zoom with the convenience of a pistol. This single round magazine sidearm grants 100% ammo efficiency for 3 seconds (that can be refreshed when active) and 0.5x Critical Damage added per headshot with a maximum of 3 stacks.\nHarrow’s signature Syandana.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Harrow. Find it in the Market or Alerts!\n\n\nReturn to Warframe’s first planet with a completely new look. Earth Remastered offers improved volumetric lighting, a conversion to PBR materials, and a new vegetation system, which create a mood and atmosphere far more advanced than the original January 2014 update did.\nThe new lush forests of Earth are yours to explore. This Update turns the formerly good-looking planet into a stunningly lush, beautifully lit, alive, organically structured environment.\nWe’ve breathed life into Earth’s ambiance by adding a greater variety of unique sounds as you move between the different areas, connecting tunnels/paths, and between the day and night cycle. You can now experience the sounds of more unique wildlife in the lush forest heavy areas, while the overrun Grineer areas focus more on the clunking and chugging of their machinery. With performance gains and a clearer and more focused mix, Earth now offers a higher level of diversity, adding to the overall experience.\nGhastly in appearance and even more unpleasant in combat, Nox is the newest Grineer experiment, a member of a tactical chem-focus unit, and enemy to the Tenno. Seared by an obsession with toxin and wielding a dart weapon that deals Toxin and Impact damage, Nox leaves clouds of deadly toxin whenever he goes. Take caution, destroying Nox’s helmet will release the toxin trapped inside. This Grineer unit is also extremely unstable and will explode in repulsive fashion when killed.\nYou may encounter Nox in enemy level 15 + Grineer missions.\nDual-wield any thrown Melee Weapon and a single-handed Secondary Weapon to destroy your enemies.

Find Harrow Systems + new 'Bane of Corrupted' Mods!\nAdded Galleon, Asteroid and Infested Ship Defection missions to Dark Sector nodes in the Star Chart (Phobos Memphis, Saturn Caracol and Neptune Yursa).\nDefection has been added to the Sortie rotation!\nYour Arsenal of Melee weapons has awaited the Riven treatment and the time has come! Rivens overall now have a 25% chance to be earned from Sorties.\n\nFor the moments where you wish you had a friend (or 3) with you in the Simulacrum to test a build!\n2 new Mandachord instrument packs are here:\nEpsilon Instruments \nElectronic!\nPlogg Instruments \nPop-rock!\n*Find them in your Arsenal for purchase!\nIn order to let you show off Earth Remastered, 3 new Captura Scenes have arrived! These can be obtained in Rare Crates on Earth:\nGrineer Forest Factory Scene\nGrineer Forest Industry Scene \nGrineer Forest Water Pump Scene\n2 Quest related Captura rooms have also been added \nbut spoilers mean we won't say too much. If you've finished Octavia's Anthem, you'll find Cephalon Suda offering a new Room. Once you finish Chains of Harrow, Red Veil will offer a new Captura room!\n\nIf you find joy in neon colors flashing to the beat of killing Grineer, plug in that Razer Chroma and enjoy the show! Please note that Razer Chroma and Warframe compatibility is a work-in-progress and more compatibility will be added as we continue to develop it.\n\n23 existing PC Achievements have been added to our Steam Achievements! For those of who you have already completed these in-game, they will be unlocked on Steam when you play the Chains of Harrow update using the Steam launcher.\nWe’ve also added 6 new Achievements to PC (and Steam), bumping the total amount of PC achievements to 172. These were already available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but now it’s our PC Tenno’s turn to try their hand at them:\nDo you think you can complete them all, Tenno?\n\nSpecial item pickups now display on the left side with emphasis rather than on the bottom resource bumper. You'll notice items like Kubrow Eggs, Weapon Blueprints, and other special items picked up in game now have more pizazz!  \nMods that are already equipped on compatible gear now have a desaturated look and icon representing that they cannot be simultaneously used on compatible gear!\nWith Archwing 2.0, players can now fire their weapons while 'sprinting'. This functionality carried over to Submersible missions, but there was no animation to go with it. An animation has been added for this functionality! \nThere is now a Sentient category in the Simulacrum! \nYou can now cycle through multi-option abilities while performing a roll. \nSelecting Emotes in the Arsenal now plays said Emote on your Warframe!\nAdded variants for enemy group knockback and get-up animations when they are struck together. \nAdded a new minimap zone marker for more interesting objectives. You will see the first example of this in Harrow’s Quest!\nAdded custom leap attack animations for the Nikana. \nAdded an “Opponent forfeited” message in Conclave Team Annihilation and Lunaro when the opponent team leaves the match instead of \"Victory\".\nAdded a “Thank you for your purchase” message when buying Slots from your Inventory.\nAdded muzzle flash to shotguns.\nAdded new blood effects for when you shoot or slash your enemies.\n",

Introducing: Orange Crits! These now occur in between Yellow and Red Crits. Before, Crits became Red when 100% Crit Chance was achieved. Now Crits will be ORANGE  in the 100.01-200% range, and Red will start at 200.01%+! This is solely a visual change. \nPolished Grineer enemy AI vault over, drop down, etc. animations. \nAdjusted skybox lighting in Pluto’s asteroid field.\nCorpus featured in the Valkyr Prime trailer now reflect the new facial feature textures in-game. \nSwapped out an old Grineer console panel with the consistent console panel in the Grineer Asteroid Fortress tileset.\nSmoothed out Stealth and Parry finisher animations. Enemies will no longer pop in front of you and instead will properly align your Warframe with the enemy during the animation.\nLowered Armor and Health for Grineer Drahks.\nFeral Kubrow have had their Armor reduced to 50.\nMade the Cycuta and Verlorum Prime Sigils appear more metallic.\nImproved glass rendering to be more accurate all in the name of good looking glass.\nAdjusted the hitbox size of some of the Grineer units’ shoulder pads so that they don’t block headshots.\nUpdated terminology for Melee combo descriptions for Portuguese and Turkish.\nMade several case changes to text in game.\nChanged Kavat animation looping from laying on side to sitting up to growl, and then lay back down. Essentially, your classic cat behavior \nunbothered. \nReplaced an old door in the Derelict tileset with a newer version.\nImproved navigation for enemies in the Corpus Ice Planet and Infested Salvage tileset.\nReduced the countdown when going to a Relay to 5 seconds. \nMade slight adjustments to the stiffness of the Zaikhya Syandana. \nSlightly tweaked Excalibur's Noble stance to have better trigger placement with his fingers. \nKubrow Eggs are now shown in the Inventory screen under the 'Misc' Tab. \nIncreased the elevator speed in Grineer Shipyard Defense missions from 14 seconds to 8 seconds.\nThought the Grakata couldn’t get any better? Well now it’s firepower sounds even more satisfying! We’ve improved it’s 3D sound to use stereo samples, which gives the Grakata a meatier sound when in close proximity to it. This gives ally and enemy Grakatas a more dynamic feel in 3D!

  "changes": "Octavia’S Anthem: Hotfix 20.6.1oberon Changes:\nObaeron, Broberon, Goat Lord...these are just a few of the names bestowed upon our faithful Oberon. With the dedicated amount of continued feedback and passionate discussions about Oberon’s changes, the time has come to release another round of changes! Oberon Prime is right around the corner so the spotlight will be on him like never before. The changes below were brought forth from Dev discussions and by you, our devoted Tenno. Our goal has always been to give synergy to Oberon’s abilities, while still giving him a way to fill multiple roles in battle. We hope these further changes do just that.\nTweaked Hallowed Ground FX to reduce performance issues.\nRange Mods now apply 75% to Range (distance from Oberon) and 75% to Arc Angle of Hallowed Ground (before was 25% to Range and 75% to Arc before).\nOberon’s Renewal now heals friendly summoned units (IE Nekros’ Shadows of the Dead) at 1/3 the rate but consumes 1/3 the Energy drain for doing so. The change to have Renewal not affect friendly summons was met with varying opinions, and is now further tweaked to meet a happy middle ground. \nOberon’s Renewal Armor buff will be applied to allies anytime they step on Hallowed Ground while Renewal is active on them as opposed to them having to be on Hallowed Ground when Renewal hits them.\nRenewal no longer affects Nidus’ Maggots as to not prevent them from exploding (their intended behavior).\nOberon’s Reckoning Armor debuff is now based on the target's base Armor instead of current Armor (meaning no more diminishing returns).\nPull, Magnetize, and Polarize can now be cast while in motion \ntheir animations now only take place on the upper body. \nRemoved the .75 second delay at the end of Mag’s Crush cast.\nEximus units can now be summoned as Inaros’ Sand Shadows. \nTweaked the Endura Idle FX to better display ‘leafy particles’. \nSaved 10MB of RAM and reduced update and startup time for players that installed from Steam or used the Offline-Installer.\n",
  "fixes": "Fixed being unable to craft the Destreza. This also fixes other items requiring Argon Crystals not being craftable. \nFixed crashing or failing to join when using the /join command to enter a player's mission.\nFixed crashing when attempting to enter the Dojo.\nFixed extracting as the Operator not applying Boosters to obtained Kuva.\nFixed a script error when attempting to Randomize your Warframe appearance in the Arsenal.\nFixed retaining the Fissure Primary Weapon buff permanently with Ivara’s Artemis Bow.\nFixed the Nidina Armor not properly applying chosen Energy color. \nFixed the Nidina Armor clipping into Frost/Frost Prime and his Skins.\nFixed some texture issues on the Ivara Youkai Skin. \nFixed some texture issues on the Repala Syandana. \nFixed seeing an empty screen when attempting to place a Decoration in the Obstacle Course. It’s fully intentional that Decorations are not placeable in the Obstacle Course, but the empty screen was not intended to appear.\nFixed underlying/default node's requirements being checked when taxiing to a Sortie mission (ie Kela's Judgement Points).\nFixed being unable to select a Relic in an Endless Fissure mission if a Relic was not brought in the mission from the start.\nFixed Hosts seeing Clients firing multiple bullets when they only fired one. \nFixed some Pistols having a weird left hand movement when firing.\n",

With this change, we also buffed the Auras: \nSpeed Holster has gone from 80% to 120% at Max Rank.\nDead Eye has gone from 35% to 52.5% at Max Rank.\nEMP Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank.\nSprint Boost Aura has gone from 10% to 15% at Max Rank. \nRemoved Lua Spy missions from Sortie rotation due to extensive Client loading times on min spec machines.

  "changes": "Fixed an issue where Chroma would deal no damage with Vex Armor active. While this may sound like a simple fix, if you're a Chroma user please read on!\nSolving Vex Armor actually takes as back to Chroma's beginning. On original power creation, we used some less-than-ideal calculation methods to create Scorn and Fury's effects. If you are an avid Chroma user, you probably know the power maximizing this ability brings. At some point in Chroma's future we will need to revisit and use ideal methods for his Abilities; we will inform you well in advance when Chroma is under review. As you may or may not know, Oberon is currently under review at this time!\nUpdated the Ability screen and HUD buff numbers to be consistent with other powers. Functionally they remain exactly the same; they just start at 0% instead of 100%.\n\nCataclysm now deals different amount of damage over the time it exists: 25% Damage when bubble is full size, 100% at its smallest size.\nCataclysm damage scaling now uses average Health + Shield instead of total Health + Shield of enemies within.\n\nNyx's Assimilate Augment for Absorb no longer Absorbs Friendly Fire.\n\nFixed a bug that would cause Banshee's Silence to last longer depending on your frame-rate (approximately 5% longer at 60 FPS, 30% longer at 30 FPS).\nBuffed Silence's base Duration to 10/15/20/30 (20% at max rank) which now matches Sonar so you can cast them in tandem.\n\nTrading Platinum while having free Platinum will now display a tip that free Platinum cannot be traded.\nCompanion silhouettes no longer show in Captura.\nFriendly Archwing markers, Atlas, Rhino, Valkyr’s custom HUD and Inaros’ resurrect HUD are now affected by the HUD scaling sliders in the Interface options.\nMoved a Kuria to a reachable area in the Grineer Shipyard tileset.\nTweaked the Synoid Gammacor's force feedback to be more consistent when using a controller.\nReduced the Rift Stasis weight of the Mutalist Quanta stackable projectile.\nRemoved the ability to friend yourself.\nRemoved the settings buttons on the lower right screen when adjusting the HUD margins. This was causing players to think they were setting the HUD margins to ‘Default’ when they were actually changing their settings to ‘Default’.\nRemoved the Anasa Ayatan Sculpture from the Codex because currently there is no way to scan it.\nChanged the Kavat icons on Mission Progress, End of Mission and Last Mission results to consistently show your Kavat's face (like the Arsenal); Pablo claims this is because they have personality.\nAdded texture-streaming prefetch-hints to for your loadout so that the Mission Progress and End of Mission screens can appear faster.\n\nOctavia’s Metronome cloak ends in if you fire/cast ability/take a pickup in Conclave.\nReduced the collision size of the Javlok primary fire projectile in Conclave.\nReduced the duration of Octavia's Metronome in Conclave.\nReduced the damage reduction of Trinity's Link in Conclave.\nFixed an issue with the Azima and Zenith doing more damage than intended in Conclave.\n\n",

  "changes": "Octavia'S Anthem: Update 20:\n\n\nDo you hear the music, Tenno? Faint memories of the Mandachord orchestra linger, and Suda wishes you follow it. Do as the Cephalon requests and be rewarded knowledge of an instrument from another time, the Mandachord. But, take caution... following her instructions may lead you down a twisted path...\nVisit the Cephalon Suda Enclave in the Relay, and speak to Suda to start the quest. You must have the Second Dream quest completed to do so.\nOctavia’s Anthem is a replayable quest! If you would like to experience it again, visit your Codex and select “Replay Quest”.\n\n\n\nCompose her song and then conduct the mighty Mandachord, turning bass, beat and melody into an anthem of devastation.\nGet Octavia today by purchasing her in the Market for Platinum, or by completing Octavia’s Anthem to get her Blueprint. Her parts can be found in the following ways:\n\nConduct your very own symphony, Tenno. Octavia’s abilities are powered by the Mandachord, a formidable tool used to mix Melody, Bass, and Percussion into a harmony of destruction. Compose a song before entering the battle by going to your Arsenal, selecting the Appearance tab, and hitting the “Mandachord” button.\nIn this guide, we will be using the Adau Instruments to get you started on composition since they are the default Mandachord Instruments. There are also 4 other Instruments available in the Market for Platinum if you own Octavia:\nAlpha Instruments\nBeta Instruments\nDruk Instruments\nGamma Instruments\nEach Instrument is in the same key (D minor Pentatonic), so if you’re feeling adventurous try mixing and matching Instruments to create unique compositions.\nThe Mandachord is comprised of 4 bars which are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (seen in the background of each bar). Placing one note at the start of each bar is a whole note. Each bar is divided into quarters which are represented by the vertical lines. The tempo is set to 120 beats per minute, meaning each bar is 2 seconds long, and each slot is a 16th note.\nThe fastest way to start your composition is to tackle the Percussion track first! Using the Adau Instruments, place the outer drum sound on every quarter note, the second drum sound on the first note of the first bar, and the third drum sound in the third slot of every quarter:\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\nYou will notice the pitch rises as you move towards the outer ring of the Mandachord. Each Instrument works this way, enabling your notes to sound at the same pitch with different Instruments. Other Instruments have different bass-only sounds for this section as well, so feel free to experiment.\n\n\nSpoiler\nYou can also form chords by placing notes together on the same beat!\nSpoiler\nSpoiler\n\nSpoiler\n\nTry maintaining the same Percussion throughout your composition.\nStart off by playing the lowest notes for the Bass in the first bar, and then increasing their pitch in each subsequent bar. Do the same for the Melody section. The key to getting good results is to slightly change the notes that are playing from bar to bar.\nThere are composition note limits:\nThe Bass track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Melody track has a 16 note limit per composition.\nThe Percussion track has a 26 note limit per composition.\nUse the “Volume Mixer” to adjust the volume for each track.\nUse “Track Isolation” to toggle each track on and off.\nUse “Reload” to revert any new changes back to the original selected/saved song.\nDon’t forget to save your compositions into a song slot. You can save a total of 5 songs!\nUse “Load Song” to select one of your custom songs or one of the default Instrument songs to load into the Mandachord.\n\nIn order to send and receive songs, you must own Octavia.\nTyping [Song] in chat will bring up a list of your saved songs to chose from. Hovering your cursor over a song will play it for easy selection:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have selected a song to share, a link with its title will appear in chat for others to save. Clicking on a song link will give you the following instructions on how to load the song into your own Mandachord:\nSpoiler\nOnce you have the song loaded into your Mandachord, you are free to edit it. You can also save shared songs, but keep in mind the 5 song slot limit.\n\nShow off your favorite Warframe and Fashion ‘Frame with the new Captura feature. Use a vast array of tools to compose the perfect shot. Choose from numerous available locations, spawn in enemies, slow down, or speed up time and compose a stunning photograph. Add more depth to your composition with dozens of filters, special effects and graphic options.\nHead to the Arsenal and select your Warframe Appearance tab. There you will see a new button titled Captura on the bottom right. Upon launching Captura, you can select from the following Captura Scenes:\nCORPUS SHIP MAINTENANCE SCENE\nGRINEER GALLEON CARGO SCENE\nINFESTED SHIP HOLOGRAM SCENE\nEach Syndicate also offers their own themed Captura Scene, available at a Standing price. Interested in applying your own background scene or having a solid color background to your Captura images? Visit Simaris in the Relay to purchase the Color Key Scene for Standing. Teshin also has Conclave Scenes to offer, visit him the in the Relay to add these to your Captura Scene selection.\nBe sure to share your Captura screenshots with the Community\nwe can’t wait to see how creative you get! https://forums.warframe.com/topic/776648-update-20-share-your-captura-screenshots/\n\n\nA high tempo rifle. Choose between automatic and semi automatic fire to lay waste to your enemies. Its primary fire rewards increased accuracy and fire rate with consistent shooting. Its alt fire will load up 10 ammo before being shot in a single blow. The Tenora can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or researched in the Tenno Lab Dojo room.\nThis fan hammer pistol, like the Tenora, also has two firing modes. Its semi-automatic primary fire will please sharpshooters. Its alt fire packs a punch (several) by emptying its entire clip in one trigger pull, but hold steady, the shots also have some kick to them. The Pandero can be purchased in the Market for Platinum or you can purchase its Blueprint in the Market for crafting.\n\nAn alternate helmet for Wukong.\nAn alternate helmet for Octavia.\nAccentuate the Kavat’s sleek profile with this enchanting decorative armor!\nWho is this gangly creature on your Landing Craft?! Who let this malformed Infested inside?! KILL IT WITH FIR\noh wait, that’s the newly reskinned Helminth Charger! With a whole new look comes a new attitude.\nFor those of you looking for the original Charger model, you can find the Helminth Degenerate Pattern as a Cosmetic Option in the Market available for Credits!\nJavlok, Buzlok, Ferrox, Harpak, Hind, Mutalist Quanta, Penthera, Paracyst, Penta, Quanta (Vandal), Stradavar, Tenora, Zarr\nAzima, Euphona Prime, Kulstar, Pandero, Talons\n5 new emotes are available for your hip-shaking convenience!\nGlissade Narta\nMaestro Narta\nPoise Narta\nTempo Narta\nPendulum Narta\nThe Relays and Maroo’s Bazaar now offer dedicated music zones, where you can share your Mandachord compositions and boogie down with fellow Tenno. Simply bring Octavia to one of the areas marked with the symbol seen in the image below, and select any of the Narta emotes listed above to start the party.\n\nDojos have a “free for all” policy when it comes to sharing your Mandachord compositions. Team up with your Clan to create symphonies in the comfort of your own Dojo, without concern of getting a noise complaint.\nDojo sessions are now hosted using the Relay system!\nThis means that Dojo sessions will be no longer be handled with the Host and Client method, eliminating potential host migrations or other host-related connectivity issues. Clan members will be able to invite other Tenno to the Dojo and leave without forcing their invitees out as well.\nFor performance’s sake, the Instance limit for Relays also applies to this new system. You and 49 other Tenno will be able to visit the Dojo at the same time before another Instance is created, and any modifications done to the Dojo will still propagate across each Instance simultaneously.\nAs a result of these changes, “Host” will be removed from the Clan Roles list since any and all Clan members will now be able to access the Dojo at all times.\nTrading in the Dojo now works similarly to trading in the Maroo's Bazaar where players can \"set up shop\". The trading post still shows all players in the Dojo with trades remaining for the day, but Players can now start a trade from the Trading Post or by interacting with another Player who is in trading mode.\nDuelling will use the original Dojo hosting system, where it will create one session for the duelling Tenno. Players will be able to trade in the Duelling Room, but not during a Duelling Session.\nA new and improved Mastery Rank-Up screen is here! When you become eligible for a rank-up, a new option to initiate your test will appear at the top of the pause menu (instead of directly under your name). Upon selecting to start your test, a new screen appears that shows you what Mastery Rank test you’re about to attempt, what rewards you will receive upon a successful completion, and helpful hints!\nSee it in action: https://twitter.com/PabloPoon/status/839946792078831616\nIn addition to the Dojo hosting changes, Clan Affinity will be awarded depending on the amount of effort expended towards bettering one’s Clan. This Clan Affinity will contribute to the Clan’s Rank and is awarded as follows:\nThe first time you construct an Oracle Room, Bio Lab, Chem Lab, Energy Lab, Tenno Lab, Orokin Lab, Duelling Room and Obstacle Course.\nThe first time you construct a Trading Post, Treasury, and Temple of Honor.\nUpon completion of Clan Research.\nThe amount of Clan Affinity earned by building Rooms or Decorations are listed in their respective selection screens; Research entries have been given the same treatment within the Lab UI. A Research tab has also been added to the Clan Profile, which will list all research and its state of completion per Lab!\nDon’t worry if your Clan has already done all or part of the above tasks \nthe rewards are retroactive! The appropriate amount of Clan Affinity has been given to all existing Clans with this Update.\nAll existing Clans are currently at the initial Rank, regardless of their Clan Affinity. Once its members complete the Ascension Ceremony, the Clan will Ascend to the highest Clan Rank attainable with their current amount of Affinity.\nWhat is this Ascension Ceremony? If you have earned enough to reach the next Rank, a new Decoration called the Ascension Altar will become active! To participate in this Ceremony, a clan member simply needs to interact with this device. Depending on your Clan Tier, a certain number of members must partake in this ceremony in order to reach Ascension, but under no time limit.\nParticipants will immediately be awarded Endo upon interacting with the Altar, and any remaining Clan members will be able to interact with the Altar and receive an Endo reward within 72 hours after the Ascension Ceremony has been completed. Participants from Clans who have enough Clan Affinity to Ascend multiple Ranks will be rewarded with Endo from each individual Rank.\nThe required number of participants per Tier are as follows:\nGhost: 1\nShadow: 5\nStorm: 15\nMountain: 30\nMoon: 50\nThe amount of Endo awarded per Clan Rank is as follows:\nRank One: 1,000\nRank Two: 2,000\nRank Three: 3,000\nRank Four: 4,000\nRank Five: 5,000\nRank Six: 6,000\nRank Seven: 7,000\nRank Eight: 8,000\nRank Nine: 9,000\nFor Clans who have earned the current max Clan Affinity at the time of this update, completing the Ascension Ceremony will award each participant (and any other player who interacts with the Altar within 72 hours after its completion) with a grand total of 45,000!\nTo remove any confusion between these new Clan Ranks and the existing ones, Clan Hierarchy is now used to describe a player’s position within the Clan, whether they are a Warlord or an Initiate.\nAll of these changes are the foundation for a larger system planned for release later this year, so stay tuned, Tenno!\nSniper Crewman now are able to deploy mini-robots known as Ratel. These fast-moving mini robotics units are quick and can quickly overwhelm even the strongest Tenno \ntake them out at the source!\nWe have increased the spawn chance of Sniper Crewman in Corpus missions. We have also reduced the spawn chance of Sapping Ospreys (which will mean less Sapper Mines) and lowered the maximum allowable simultaneous instances of Sapping Ospreys.\nBow and Sniper lovers rejoice! A new strategy for annihilating Nullifiers is now available. Nullifier backpacks are now equipped with Projector Drones that are deployed overhead. These Projector Drones are the power source behind the Nullifiers’ bubbles, and determine the growth, size, and vitality of the bubble. Here is what you can expect from the Nullifiers’ updated backpacks:\nWhen alerted for the first time, Nullifiers will deploy their Projector Drone to create a bubble.\nWhen in contact with varying ceiling heights, the Projector Drone will adjust its own height and reduce the size of the bubble to remain targetable.\nIf the bubble has been popped, the Projector Drone will return to the backpack for a brief period of time before being deployed again.\nIf the Projector Drone is destroyed, the bubble will pop and render the Nullifier permanently unable to make bubbles.\nProjector Drone health scales with enemy level.\nFixed Nullifiers so that stealth finisher targets don’t grow the bubble, as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/765409-bug-with-nullifiers-and-stealth-kills\nThe World State Window now has progressive disclosure and will only display the missions and Categories for content in which a player has met the criteria. Some of this is partially in place, but this is a more exhaustive change that ensures new players are not overwhelmed by seeing content they cannot play.\nAlerts will only appear in the World State Window if you have the planet unlocked.\nInvasions will only show if you have the planet unlocked.\nSorties will only become visible after completing The War WIthin.\nSyndicate Daily Missions only appear if a player is a member of a Syndicate.\nVoid Fissures will not appear until a player obtains their first Relic\nLimbo is a Warframe with one of the most complicated skillsets. When his skills are mastered, he becomes an unstoppable force of Rift manipulation. While many have perfected the Limbo, there's been a general sense he needs to be revisited to make the mastering feel more rewarding.\nWith this Update, we have revisited Limbo.  Changes to Limbo include the following:\nWhile in the Rift, Limbo receives a slight Energy regeneration. Additionally, enemies killed in the Rift will grant Limbo 10 Energy.\nLimbo darts in and out of different Planes of existence at no Energy cost. Tapping the roll key (default binding Shift) will shift Limbo between the Rift and Material Plane. Shifting into the Rift leaves behind a tear that, for a brief period of time (5s), Limbo and Allies can use it to enter the Rift. Limbos that enter the Rift through the tear can remain in the Rift as long as they please, unlike Allies who have temporary access.\nSend enemies and Allies within a small radius into or out of the Rift for a period of time. Banish targets must be in the same Plane as Limbo to be affected. For example, Limbo must be in the Material Plane to Banish Material Plane targets to the Rift and vice versa. Banished enemies will take damage when casted and will be knocked down for a brief period of time.\nStop Banished enemies in their tracks by putting them in Stasis for a period time. Toggle the ability on and move within the Rift to strategically set up shots around enemies affected by Stasis. Projectiles will stay suspended until the Stasis timer runs out, until toggled off, or until the 300 projectile limit has been reached, upon which your torrent of projectiles will be launched at the enemy.\nVoid energy surges through Limbo and into the Rift, charging enemies within it. Charged enemies that cross over to the Material Plane will Banish themselves and nearby enemies back into the Rift. When charged enemies die outside of the Rift, they surge and transfer the charge to nearby enemies.\nBridging the Rift and Material Planes, Cataclysm creates a sphere of Void Energy that shifts enemies within its radius into the Rift. During its creation and final collapse, enemies stumble and take damage. The sphere’s final collapse deals damage to enemies both in and out of the sphere, and scales based on the health and shields of ALL enemies in the Rift.\nMission objective items, such as Datamass, can now be carried in and out of the Rift Plane. However! Be careful not to drop these items in the Rift Plane, as they can only be picked up in the Material Plane.\nAllies in Cataclysm's sphere can now collect pickups including mission objective items.\nThe Rift Torrent Augment Mod will now grant Limbo a damage increase (15/20/25/30%) for every enemy affected by Rift Surge and has had it’s description changed to reflect this.\nToned down the FX while in the Rift.\nAs we near the staggering number of 300 weapons (including variants), the task of balancing grows increasingly daunting. At its core, Warframe is a co-operative game; having powerful tools is a boon to a team rather than a disadvantage. However, there are a few weapons that have such a dominating effect in missions that co-operative missions essentially become solo. Aside from the handful of dominating weapons, there are even more that have been overlooked.\nThe Miter is one of the oldest examples of killer concept with lackluster results. The next Update will bring the following:\nIncreased chance of dismemberment on kills.\nIncreased speed of Projectiles.\nCharge time has been halved.\nCritical Chance of 5% for a quick shot.\nCritical Chance of 10% for a charged shot.\nHit detection is now based on the size of the Sawblade.\nMastery Rank increased to 6.\nThe Harpak's stats aren't the worst in the scheme of Primaries, but it has received some love since it is often overlooked.\nRecoil has been reduced on the Primary Fire.\nThe Alt-Fire Charge time has been removed \nit is now an instant harpoon.\nThe Critical Chance has been increased to 20%.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire from 15 meters to 40 meters.\nIncreased the flight speed of the Alt-Fire and updated the FX.\nAdjusted pull strength of the Harpak’s alt fire to have enemies more likely to end up near you.\nThe Hind has more nicknames than most Primaries (Baguette, etc), but not as much use.\nWe've added a single-shot Semi-Auto Alt Fire to the Hind that has increased Damage, Critical, and Status Chance.\nLike the Miter, the Panthera is a killer idea with lackluster execution. We've made the following changes:\nPrimary Fire has been switched to Automatic, and the fire rate has been increased.\nThe Status Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 20%\nCritical Hit Chance of Primary Fire is now 10%\nThe Critical Multiplier is now 2x.\nAmmo Requirement is reduced to 2.\nSecondary Fire Status chance is now 35%\nCritical hit Chance of Secondary is now 25%\nHit detection is now based on the size of the projectile.\nMastery Rank is now 7.\nThe Paracyst is one of the more spine-tingling weapons in the Arsenal that really runs with the Infested theme.\nThe damage of the Primary Fire has been increased by 5.\nUpdated the FX of the projectiles of the Primary Fire.\nIncreased the range of the Alt-Fire tether to 50 m.\nThe Status Chance of the Primary and Secondary Fire has been increased to 30%\nThe Critical Chance of Primary Fire has been increased to 10%\nMastery Rank is now 5.\nThe Mutalist Quanta is getting more of a mechanic change rather than just stats.\nIt will have its Alt-Fire stack similar to the Simulor to make a large Infested Orb that you can shoot through for additional stats.\nThe Buzlok and its homing mechanism has been used for many creative moments \nbut ultimately this weapon has been overlooked.\nThe Ammo Requirement for the Secondary Homing has been reduced to 2.\nPhysical Damage distribution has been adjusted to 50% Impact, 40% Puncture, and 10% Slash.\nDamage has been increased to 60 from 45.\nCritical Chance increased to 15%\nCritical Damage increased to 2.5x\nThe flight speed of the Homing Beacon has been increased.\nThe Homing Beacon will now only stick to NPC & Characters.\nCritical Chance increased by 50% on targets with Homing Beacon attached to them.\nClip size reduced to 50.\nMastery Rank increased to 9.\nThe Ice Beam weapon: the Glaxion. Probably one of the most exciting weapons to imagine in combat, yet it has received a cold reception.\nCold Damage has increased to 333 from 250.\nThe rate at which ammo is consumed has been decreased.\nIncreased the Accuracy of the Glaxion.\nReduced the range from 30 meters to 24 meters.\nThe Ogris has gone through a visual Upgrade, and now it's time for a stat upgrade. To many, this was their first entry into Launcher weapons \nare you willing to give it another look?\nThe Flight Speed of the projectile has been increased.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 35%.\nThe charge time to fire the Ogirs has been reduced.\nThe direct Impact damage of the projectile has been decreased to 100.\nAoE damage has increased to 600.\nAoE range has increased to 6 meters.\nMastery Rank requirement has increased to 8.\nThe Attica was the debut entry into Automatic Primary Crossbows! We've revisited it to perhaps bring it back into the spotlight of your Arsenal.\nThe Weapon Recoil has been reduced.\nThe Fire Rate has been increased.\nThe Flight Speed of the bolts has increased.\nThe Critical Chance has increased to 25%.\nThe Critical Multiplier has increased to 2x.\nThe Ammo Capacity has increased to 20.\nWe have nerfed 3 weapons (plus 1 variant)  that we feel disrupts the co-op setting and pace of gameplay for most groups:\nThe Tonkor's rocket jumping mechanic has long been obsolete since the introduction of bullet jumping, so the Tonkor now deals self-damage like all other launchers.\nThe Tonkor Grenade trajectory line now appears on holding the fire button (Default Left Mouse), and grenade fires on release.\nThe grenade needs to travel 6m before arming itself, it will bounce off yourself, other players and AI before then.\nThe Maximum lifespan of grenade has dropped from 5 to 3 seconds \ngrenades are quicker to explode\nGrenades bounce lower and explode sooner, making them more likely to explode where they are shot.\nThe Critical Chance has been reduced to 25%.\nThe Accuracy of the Tonkor has been increased.\nThe Simulor's entry into Arsenals marked one of the more unique moments in Weapon history. It's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance has been increased to 30%.\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 3.\nA Critical Chance of 2% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-6 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (225 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-6 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-40\nThe Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 60.\nConsidering the Simulor was the only Primary Cephalon weapon, it was easy to see a Synoid version entering Arsenals. Like its vanilla counterpart, it's always been a little weird \nstacking orbs together leads to both passive and active death. The stacking itself causes damage and the fully stacked orb can be activated with your 'Alt Fire' button for an additional explosion.\nThe Status Chance increased to 35%\nThe amount of Orbs required to make a full stack has decreased \nit used to take 5, now it takes 4.\nA Critical Chance of 5% has been added.\nThe AoE Explosion range (based on stack when expires or manual detonation) increased from 0.5-2.8 meters to 1-8 meters.\nThe Explosion Damage has increased from 50 per orb to 75 (300 at full stack).\nOn an orb stacking event (when orbs combine), damage range decreased to 1-8 from 3-8\nOn an orb stacking event, damage decreased from 150-250 to 20-50\nThe Synoid Simulor has had its max Ammo Capacity reduced to 75.\nThe only melee entry on the list is the Telos Boltace.\nThis weapon is receiving a bit more of a mechanic change rather than a purely numerical change.\nThe Slide attack will create a vortex that staggers and draws enemies toward you.\nThe following Slide attack (after a vortex) will radial blast and ragdoll enemies away from you.\nThis 'back and forth' will be on a cooldown.\nIf you have invested into a nerfed weapon, when the Update releases there will be an Inbox message generated on Login to give you a single 3 day Affinity Booster and a Forma per owned weapon to reconfigure your weapons as you see fit!\nRegarding any Rivens you may have or are looking to pick up for any of the listed weapons: you can expect small changes to stats. Stay tuned for more information in the Update notes!\nFixed the Tether Grenade Mod for the Penta cancelling Self Damage.\nThere is now a toggle option for how you want to fly: old vs. new! This option allows players to switch between the original Archwing flight system that we introduced vs the newer one we added. You can find this in the Options menu by going to Controls > Archwing > Toggle Experimental Flight!\nRemoved unusable Ammo Drops from Archwing.\nImproved the radius and 'suck speed' of Archwing's innate vacuum.\nThe Vulkar Wraith is now tradable!\nEmotes no longer remain active while changing your Arsenal in the Relay.\nFocus Convergence Orbs will now spawn closer to you \nbefore they would spawn within 40 to 80 meters, now they will spawn within 30 to 60 meters.\nThe Judgement points required to enter the various Rathuum missions and to fight Kela de Thaym on Merrow have been reduced! The Judgement points earned remains the same.\nYam now requires 10 judgement points.\nVodyanoi now requires 15 judgement points\nMerrow now requires 25 judgement points.\nAll of the Index mission options available on The Index node on Neptune have been removed, except for the Endurance mode. This node is optional, and is not required to complete Neptune. Since Endurance modes play out with no explicit end, we've made all Index enemies drop all Index exclusive modes so that you can remain in the same Endurance mission without missing out on drops that the enemies don't spawn.\nDecreased the hit box on the Grineer Rollers to better match the visual mesh.\nReduced particles from the Telos Boltace slide attack as per: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/764794-balance-the-telos-boltace/?page=2#comment-8431700\nRe-arranged Stims to appear together in Dojo Research.\nAdded mini-map marker for Dojo Transporter.\nRemoved bounding boxes of Dojo and Orbiter Decorations, except around Triggerable or Interactive sections of Decorations. This means you will have a much, much easier time placing Decorations!

A distance label is also added to this Marker (but will disappear when they are being revived).\nImproved visuals of Grineer Blunt.\nChanged translations on Resource Drone extract button to be singular if only 1 Extractor is ready.\nTweaked the location of a Kuria in the Shipyards!\nThe objective count in Mobile Defense missions will now disappear a couple seconds after all objectives have been successfully completed.\nUpdated Sargas Ruk’s face with wrinkle data so that you can see his anger in all of its wrinkled glory.\nChanged the console action text and its marker to hover over the console screen instead of floating above it in the first mission of Vor’s Prize.\nAdded extra navigation Marker in first mission of Vor’s Prize to make path clearer.\nUpdated the Corpus Turret animations for performance improvements.\nChoosing the default Ash skin for Ash Prime now removes all Ash Prime details.\nImproved cloth physics on several Sugatras (Boloket Sugatra, Scyth Sugatra, Ki'Teer Sugatra, and the Tentacyst Sugatra).\nOptimized numerous Dojo decorations for improved performance.\nImproved AI navigation in a number of Infested Salvage tiles.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Corpus art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to a number of Dojo art objects.\nAdded PBR touches to numerous Infested Hive art objects.\nAdjusted the difficulty scaling of the Spy Mission portion of Vor’s Prize Quest.\nUpdated a number of Warframe Skin icons to make them all more consistent.\nLowered the specular lightning on the Smeeta Kavat to address ‘plastic’ looking issues.\nImproved the loading times of certain HUD elements.\nAdjusted the lighting in the Perrin Sequence Lunaro map.\nImproved the dual wielding functionality of Sentient enemy types.\nAdded additional Relay flavor NPCs.\nPerformed a lighting pass on the Infested Corpus tileset for improved reflection fidelity.\nDisabled the mini-map during the mountain pass section of The War Within quest.\nTweaked the visuals of the trade offering icon shown above player’s heads during the trade process.\nTweaked the visual appearance of a number of Infested coral art objects.\nUpdated the wrinkle maps seen on the faces of Grineer Marines.\nThe recruiting channel can now be joined while in a PvP lobby.\nImprove the spawning logic of interactive consoles in Mobile Defense matches to ensure a better spread.\nMagnetize used by enemy NPC Mag’s will now have a 1 second delay before the actual ability is deployed to prevent players from instantly 1-shotting themselves when facing these enemies.\nChanged flashing reticule hitmaker to be simulated locally for Clients to provide better visual damage feedback if they have a poor connection to Host.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker when jumping or Bullet Jumping near enemies.\nFixed an issue with the flashing reticule hitmaker during Vauban’s Vortex, and Nezha’s Blazing Chakram and Warding Halo.\nUpdated NPC idle animations.\nChanged the tints on the default shader for the Latron as it was all dark, and not fitting the icon!\nThe Corpus Ship Tileset has received an ambiance overhaul.\nNote from George the Audio Director: “We wanted to give this tileset an audio refresh because most of the sounds were created over 3 years ago. In that time we have come up with tech that lets us play ambient sounds in a more realistic way and in a way that makes the levels feel more alive. In addition to the new tech, we also created a lot of new sounds that are unique to this tileset, in order to make it feels more Corpus-like.”\nPuzzle push-volumes now affect Warframes with knockdown immunity (Iron Skin, Warding Halo).\nReduced the MASHED Glyph diorama lighting in the Market to improve visibility.\nMade some adjustments to the Invincibility marker in the HUD so that it is more legible.\nRemoved Corpus Ship room that was unintentionally included in the Corpus Outpost tileset.\nImproved melee weapon holster transition animation for the customizable hostler positions to fix snapping.\nMade several optimizations for Relay performance.\nLowered the brightness on Excalibur's Blind cast and Drone Explosion deaths to avoid excessive bloom.\nNavigation panel information (not quest related) will now be hidden when playing through Vor's Prize.\nGrineer Helmets have been given the PBR treatment to better match their bodies!\nLowered the camera level when in the Archwing Arsenal to better view your Warframe.\nChanged Rhino’s Roar to only buff non-Tenno allies with a weapon -\nthis avoids the confusion when things like the Defense pod would suddenly start glowing strangely when near a Roar.\nUpdated the icons for the Chroma Drevni and Chroma Vojnik skins to include shots of the default Helmet (with the skin colours applied) to resolve confusion.\nChanged the Hostage/Rescue Target's in-world marker border from white to blue to match the icon color.\nImproved scaling and offset of items when viewing them in the Codex.\nChanged Atlas' Rumblers HUD marker from objective to Allied NPC.\nChanged Grineer Galleon tiles used during the Nav Segment phase of Vor’s Prize to show off a more visually interesting/less confusing route.\nCorpus Ship and Infested Ship door caps are now off instead of red.\nTweaked Mesa’s Noble Rifle animation to remove a pop in the movement.\nThe Braton Prime, Braton Vandal, Aklato, Lato Prime, and Lato Vandal have all had their firing sounds remastered!\nYou will now continue to be in a crouched position when jumping while crouching.\nWe have made some changes that largely affect the duration of Lunaro matches.

It's base value is 2000 Endo. \nAdded Grineer Kuva Fortress Assault and Infested Salvage missions into the Sortie mix.\nSortie missions can now be placed on nodes that may already have an active real time-mission.\nImplemented Sortie generation logic that ensures the missions selected don't weigh too heavy on endless variants. \nFixed a couple of Corpus Lua nodes whose tileset was incorrectly pointing at the Grineer variant.\nAs an example, take a look at how the Jackal looks now when he's invulnerable:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C23_RC4WIAAYL3F.jpg:large\nNew spawn locations have been introduced for Ayatan Sculptures in all levels. \nThe Credit Boost function for the Secura Lecta has changed. Before, you could get on average 11.6x Credits from kills. This chance has changed and now scales with Mastery Rank. At Mastery Rank 8, you'll get on average 2x Credits from kills. This increase continues with your Mastery Rank. At Mastery Rank 18 you'll get on average 4x Credits from kills (capped). No other changes were made regarding synergies (i.e Chroma's Effigy, etc) \nonly the weapon's Credit boosting functionality has been touched.\nRemoved the Credit cost from Maroo's Ayatan to Endo conversion in Maroo's Bazaar.\nIncreased the drop chances for Mods dropped from Ogma's.\nMines dropped by Mine Osprey are now shootable after the drone drops them (previously you could only shoot them before they were dropped).\nIn-mission challenges that require killing with a weapon will no longer appear if you can't actually complete them (Sword Alone mode, etc).\nRemoved the Secondary-kills challenge in Archwing since there are no Archwing Secondary weapons.\nChanged the Howl of the Kubrow quest phase description from \"Wait for your Kubrow to mature\" to \"Incubate and mature a Kubrow using the Incubator\" as Maturing is now done manually by players. \nImproved the elemental FX of the Ohma’s to better follow the animation (most noticeable when holstered).\nTweaked Frost’s Snowglobe to improve visibility in dark lit areas, and reduces the density of which can block your view.\nRemoved Lotus’ “Job well done” VO at the end of the Second Dream missions.\nMOTD in Player-hosted Dedicated Servers are now limited to 128 characters. \nJ3 Jordas Golem’s weak points in The Jordas Verdict will now only activate after the Golem has been purged at each new perch. This fixes being unintentionally able to bypass Nerves and kill Golem.\nVolt’s Discharge no longer causes damage to Golem’s weak points in The Jordas Verdict.

Enemies that are shot with projectiles that are silent and/or without a sound effect will now report a visual perception (rather than doing nothing). Previously enemies knew the exact location of their attacker when taking damage, regardless of the source. \nMore performance optimizations for the Helminth Infirmary. \nImproved Operator Void Dash aiming and collision on Kuva Clouds to be more forgiving.\nInbox messages for gifts no longer intrude and interrupt gameplay.\nTweaked the Sentinel Regen Mod description to include new invulnerability mechanic. \nTweaked the Atomos rumbling feedback duration when using a controller.\n",

Now to pop the Maggots you’ll need to cast Virulence on them and rejoice in your hard earned Stack accumulation.

Regarding Nitain specifically, the majority of our recently active players have less than 9 Nitain in their accounts and there is considerable interest in some new ways to acquire, so we are trying out Sorties as an option.

Underpowered, unprepared and forced out of your comfort, you must find it in yourself to improvise, not just to save yourself but the fate of all Tenno. The Queens' Fortress awaits, where both Warframe and Operator will be pushed past their limits as they slowly unravel mysteries about the Tenno’s past and their true capabilities.\nThe next chapter to 'The Second Dream' has arrived. Knowing what the Tenno are is just the beginning of your story. It is time to face The War Within.\nHow to access this Quest: If you've completed the Sedna Junction, you will receive this quest immediately on login via Inbox message.\nIf you do not receive The War Within Quest upon login be sure to have the Second Dream Quest and Sedna Junction completed. An inbox message will automatically appear once you have done so.\nOnce you've progressed far enough in The War Within to discover The Kuva Fortress, a new region will appear on your Solar Chart!\nPlay through and experience some of our most difficult and heavily fortified missions yet.\nWith this set, we knew we wanted to provide an awe-inspiring entry into the world of the Grineer Queens and Kuva. This set is complete with the latest in graphics enhancements like Volumetric Lighting, and includes some of the first ever Archwing Enemy incorporation into foot missions. Don't forget to aim up, Tenno.\nNew Music can be discovered while playing these missions, Keith Power brings us his creepiest compositions to date!\nThere comes a new way to obtain power \nfinish the War Within to receive your first entry. More information is out there… if you can find it.\nAfter you complete The War Within, Kuva Siphons may appear on Hard Grineer Environments (Sedna, Kuva Fortress, Uranus). These are side-quests related to the larger goals of the Grineer Empire. You will encounter new enemies here, and be required to use the skills learned in The War Within to prevail.\n\nFourth and fifth weapons exist… but defeating The War Within will be necessary to discover them.\nFrost & Frost Prime now have cloth physics! For years our favourite Master of Ice has had a rather static cloak, but no more! \nSolo Mode missions now start after just 5 seconds! \nDecorator Mode is now here for Dojos and Landing Crafts! This mode allows you to access a special menu where you can continuously change the items in your Landing Craft or Dojo. All the hassle of returning to the menu over and over for each placement are gone. \nAvailable daily Clem and weekly Maroo missions have been added to the World State Window under Alerts! \nA Mastery Rank 23 test has been added! The War Within introduces enough content to push long-term players that are currently Mastery Rank 22 into Mastery Rank 23! \nThe ‘squished face’ Kavat has received it’s visual update! Thanks to feedback here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/679889-persian-kavats/ we've revised the visuals of this Kavat face. We hope you enjoy the new and improved look! \nAdded in a Graphical Preset option to the Display Settings tab. Adjusting this will alter all graphical settings accordingly.\nAdded in a Fast Travel option to relays to allow for quick access to Darvo’s Shop, Cephalon Simaris! These options now join the Conclave and Navigation as quick access points. \nA more robust Display Options menu is here! You can now disable or enable more Graphics Quality options!\nGrineer Fortress ‘Bunkers’ Conclave Map has been added for Team Annihilation and Annihilation! Take control of the security systems and turrets scattered throughout this Map and use them against other players. Take note: other players aren’t the only thing you have to worry about.\nArbiters of Hexis ‘Arbiter's Arena’ Lunaro Map has been added! The Arbiters of Hexis know there is more to the Tenno than just being good Warriors – they know them to be excellent Lunaro players as well! Seek truth through discipline and practice on this new Arbiters of Hexis themed Lunaro map. The perpendicular goals will require skill, precision, and teamwork to overcome. Bring your passion to the sands of this Lunaro map today!\n",
  "changes": "Warframe Update 19: The War Within:\n'Finally it's here' the developers and players said in unison with tears (of joy?) in their eyes! When traditional developers pen their open letters at launch, it's often the last step after months or years of development. It's often a sign-off to address the people who are about to dive into the finished work of a collective group. But Warframe is far from traditional and our work is never done.\nThe War Within is here on PC! This is the next chapter in the story of Warframe. What we set out to do always seems a little wild in hindsight, but it's the thrill and ambition of storytelling that drives us to challenge ourselves and you. We want to grow and change Warframe in interesting ways. We're presenting you another chapter of growth today.\nThis chapter tells a story of your patience, our gratitude, and of course some wonderful evolution for the game. We're introducing an awe inspiring and dangerous environment: the Kuva Fortress. We're pushing our engine technology to bring you graphic improvements. We're bringing you a story about your past.\nThe War Within is also a reflection of lessons for us on how to feed, respect, and tame the growing animal that is Warframe. This update's name has outgrown itself and it represents something bigger. If you asked any of us 4 years ago what we expected to happen with this project, none of us would believe you if you showed us this day.\nWe are beyond lucky to have hard working people at Digital Extremes to bring this chapter of Warframe to life. We are grateful to have you to share it with.\nThank you Tenno. We hope you enjoy another Update that's free from us to you.\n\nEver since the change to the new Solar Chart in Specters of the Rail, the Invasion system hasn't exactly been exciting or novel. The War Within brings some much needed freshness to this part of the game!\nPrior Sortie Season Vandal and Wraith rewards can now be offered as invasion rewards by the respective faction. \nInterception missions have been added into the mix when playing for invading faction.\nWinning factions will now 'Occupy' the node for up to 24 hours. During this period, the invaders will raid the location for resources towards a mysterious 'Construction Project'\nThe mission type at a particular Invasion node will change every 15 minutes.\nThe progress of an invasion can now lead to a Faction Specific event! Watch closely as the Grineer and Corpus gather enough strength!\nFactions now pay an additional 1000 Credits each time you run a mission for them on the same node (up to max of 10K).\nFixed issues with Invasion missions loading to black and no spawning enemies. \nFixed Invasion progress not counting if a player was in mission during a Hotfix. \nFixed Phorid occupied nodes still showing the underlying bosses.\nSorties were introduced in The Second Dream. They originally launched with 'Seasons' that rotated with set rewards. Since launch we iterated in several ways, including adding repeatable/non-repeatable rewards and more. Now we bring you more change with The War Within: Sortie Seasons are no more. We now have a set reward list of rewards that are always repeatable.\nThe new pre-requisite to access Sorties is completion of The War Within. \nNezha Parts have moved to the Tenno Lab in player Dojos. \nVandal and Wraith weapon parts have moved to the Invasion System as rewards for their respective factions. \nSortie Rewards are now set as:\nVarious Endo Amounts\nOrokin Catalyst\nOrokin Reactor\nExilus Adapter\nA random Focus Lens\nLegendary Core\n1 new item coming soon (see below)!\nThere is a new addition to Sortie rewards, but this will be revealed upon completion of The War Within.\nInterception, Defense, Survival, and Excavation Endless Void Fissure Missions have been revamped and now function in a new way!\nFirst, every reward interval can have it's own Relic selected and opened (if you get enough Reactant per interval).\nSecondly, the reward intervals are as follows (for clarity):\nDefense: 5 Waves.\nInterception: 1 Round.\nSurvival: 5 Minutes.\nExcavation: 200 Cryotic.\nShould you collect the necessary Reactant per interval and open your Relic, a bonus will occur and you will be allowed to re-select a new Relic for the next interval! The bonuses are as follows:\nEvery time you open a Relic, you get a pre-determined booster. These boosters stack the longer you stay.  \nThe first interval: 1.25x Affinity.\nThe second interval: 1.25x Credits.\nThe third interval: 1.25x Resources.\nThe fourth interval: 1.25x Resource Drop Rate. \nThe fifth interval: a random Exceptional Relic (that can be used in the same mission). \nThe sixth interval: 1.5x Affinity (replaces first).\nThe seventh interval: 1.5x Credits (replaces second).\nThe eighth interval: 1.5x Resources (replaces third).\nThe ninth interval: 1.5x Resource Drop Rate (replaces fourth).\nThe tenth interval: a higher tier random Flawless Relic (that can be used in the same mission). \nOnce you get to the fifteenth interval, you'll receive a random Radiant Relic (that can be used in the same mission. \nBoosters continue to increase every set of intervals and are capped at double (2x).\nRadiants on every fifth interval past the fifteenth. \nEvery Relic opened will result in Traces!\nCapture enemy types are now split into 3 tiers\nEasy (1-10), Medium (10-20), Hard (20+).\nCorpus Nullifiers and white-suited Corpus Targets (capable of creating a Snow Globe-esqe barrier) no longer appear on lower level Capture missions.\nChanged \"X Offset\" option to adjust Holster Position to move along to edge of your Warframe.\nAdded \"Attach Part\" option to select specific areas to Holster. Standard Holsters also have this option.\nAdded \"Z Offset\" option to adjust Holster Position distance from your Warframe.\nVolumetric Lighting technology is here and has been implemented in The War Within quest!\nWe've also improved player lighting and added various weather effects to the game.\nImprovements on collisions, and clipping on all Archwings have been made across the board!\nValkyr's Paralysis no longer deals damage in Conclave.\nValkyr's Paralysis range has been reduced in Conclave.\nImproved the explosive visual effects seen when throwing weapons make impact on players in Conclave matches to better represent energy drain.    \nFixed the UI displaying the wrong half-time indication when rejoining a Lunaro game in progress.\nFixed Client loadout changes in the lobby not syncing properly. \nFixed an issue with Titania’s Razorwing ability appearing as ready-to-cast without sufficient energy in Conclave matches.\nFixed a couple of unintended hiding spots in the Forgotten Halls Conclave map.\nFixed a couple of map holes allowing players to see out of the level in the Freight Line Conclave map.\nThe Player Profile diorama now includes your custom Operator!\nActivating your Focus ability in mission now occurs on holding your '5' key (or whatever binding you have) rather than tapping. \nMade changes to some Motion Blur instances on power cast and damage events, we will adjust this based on your feedback! \nFixed some general behaviour with enemies regarding awareness of their environment:\nNullifiers now notice and investigate their bubble taking damage \nEnemies will notice and investigate corpses\nEnemies affected by Coolant Leak will notice that they've been frozen/slowed\nThe Landing Craft extraction door has received an upgraded look! \nMade several optimizations to host-performance in the Law of Retribution and the Jordas Verdict\nOptimized periodic single-frame lag-spikes that would occur in many missions\nRadial Shared Affinity no longer includes a stealth multiplier (if active). \nThe Kubrow and Kavat section of the Player Profile has been renamed to Companions.\nWhips can now use any longsword holster customization. \nScaled the Plastid Carapace ship decoration to match in-game size.  \nTweaked the original Grineer riot shield to be a bit more metallic.\nBlocking with the Silva and Aegis increases both Critical and Status Chance by 15% (max 60%) to next attack. \nBlocking with the Ack and Brunt now absorbs elemental damage. Example: Block Electrical damage, gain + Electrical damage on top of base attacks.\nAyatan Sculptures now show number of socketed Stars when viewed in your Inventory. \nReplaced outdated Mod tips with new tips about the Ayatan system.\nTweaked Relay hub room lighting to better represent each room.\nVenus \nV Prime is now a Survival mission instead of Rescue due to there only being one low tier Survival mission. \nYou will no longer be able to see or pickup Syndicate Medallions if you have already completed that mission prior to being invited. \nReduced the brightness when viewing Landing Craft Resource Decorations.\nChanged the default text for arrows from SKIN to ARROW SKIN.\nImproved transitions when selecting different Stance animations in the Arsenal.\nImproved the look of the fog effects on the Corpus Gas City tileset.\nAdjusted the blocking volumes on elevators on the Corpus Ice Planet Tileset to prevent players from being able to accidentally exit the level.\nImproved the sound effects for the Scorpion enemy type. \nAdjusted the minimum level of Bursas to help spread out their presence across the Star Chart:\nMission Level 15+ = Denial Bursa\nMission Level 20+ = Drover Bursa\nMission Level 25+ = Isolator Bursa\nTyl Regor is now vulnerable to Corrosive procs. \nImproved the overall performance of multiple Warframe ability visual effects.\nImproved Lunaro save detection.\nAdjusted the coloring of the lens flare seen while channeling.\nAdjusted and improved the sound effects heard when grappled by Infested Ancients and Isolator Bursa units.    \nStealth master tests will now wait for performed finishers to finish before resetting themselves.\nAdjusted the difficulty of Spy vault hack consoles to prevent the most difficult hack from occurring on mission difficulties lower than level 100.\nThe icon used to displayed dropped weapons from a disarm move now use the same Friendly marker on the minimap instead of the major objective iconography.\nThe Companion stasis grid will now display Polarization counts for pets who have been Forma’d.\nThe New Strange Defense wave count has been reduced from 10 to 5.\nAdjusted Rapier idles to minimize visible foot sliding.\nImproved the back-end spawning logic of AI types for increased performance.\nThe Grineer Shipyard tileset has received a visual update! Objects are shinier and rocks are now PBR\nwhoa! \nReduced the damage of the Static Discharge Mod due to the Prova dealing (at least) 5 ticks of damage during the charge attack.\nImproved motion blur edges to appear less disorienting.  \nImproved jumping animations to be smoother.\nRemoved the Void Fissure end of mission reward selection screen when playing Solo or if no other player joins. \nOptimized the memory usage of the flashlight. \nWarning lights and sounds will now play upon Raptor NS’ Energy Mortar attack.\nYou can now go to Maroo’s Bazaar even if you have reached your daily trade limit.

If you hadn’t guessed it already, Carrier usage represents almost 80% of the total used Sentinels, and considering we have more than 5 unique choices this needed balancing. Today we're eager to introduce a community driven experiment within the Sentinel class. This is not the final book in this conversation, just the beginning.\nWe've also mentioned Kubrow/Kavat are not off the table. What we want to do is measure. We know where Carrier sits in usage compared to the rest of the options. We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.\nWe're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!\nCarrier’s precept has been automatically changed to Ammo Case \nnow increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.\n\n\n\nResearch it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!\n",

GLYPH is now the catch-all word for Profile Pictures, so you'll see your Glyph selection determine that and your Forum Profile!\nIf you're asking yourself 'Where are my Fusion Cores and what is Endo?\", please read this section carefully! This section explains the conversion from a Fusion Core / Duplicate Mod fusion system to the Endo Fusion system.\nFusion in Warframe is one of the main systems that encourages investment in your Mod collection and Upgrading your gear. With calculated clicking and collecting, you can take your unranked Mods to top tier performers.\nWith the change to an Endo system we've removed the hidden complexity of Fusion. This Endo Fusion system maintains many aspects of the hold.\nWhat is Endo? Endo is Fusion energy incarnate. It is the raw resource that powers the process of Upgrading Mods. In essence, Endo serves as the simplifier in all things Fusion. All duplicate Mods can now be simply converted into Endo. Endo will now drop from enemies and missions where Fusion Cores used to be.\nFusing with Endo makes the Mod Rank increases clear, as the system now only increases in whole Ranks. Partial upgrading with unclear requirements towards your next rank will no longer exist, and neither will wasted Fusion energy. The UI will tell you exactly how much Endo is needed for the next Rank, which gives you a clear goal to work toward.\nAny partial Mod upgrades before this Update will be refunded with equivalent Endo and Credits.\nTreasures: discoverable ancient valuables that can be constructed and converted into high Endo quantities. \nTrading of Endo (in the form of Treasures).\nAdded Rarity colour grading to the Relic Reward selection screen in Fissure missions. \nSoft launch of colourblind door symbols! These new symbols should help you determine if a door is locked or unlocked, as they no longer rely on the sole use of colour. \nAdded a warning message when the last member of an Alliance’s creator Clan tries to dissolve the Clan. \nAdded indicators in the Arsenal of how many Forma are installed in gear, and whether or not gear has been fully Mastered! \nAdded a waypoint marker for Cephalon Fragments. \nAdded more Relic Rewards into Rotation A in replacement of some Credit Bundles and Mods.\n",
  "changes": "The Silver Grove:\nLunaro has been out in the wild for a couple of weeks now, and in this time we've been play testing extensively \ninternally and externally \nand have been listening to your feedback. In an effort to address your concerns and increase the overall playability of the mode we've implemented a number of new gameplay features, arenas, customizations, and back end systems. Read on below for further details:\nNew Conclave weapon skins for the following weapons can now be purchased for standing from Tehsin once you’ve acquired the Typhoon rank:\nHaven't played any Lunaro since launch? Feeling a bit rusty? Well worry no more! The introduction of the new Lunaro Warm-Up system will take players currently waiting in a not full lobby and load them all into a practice session. These sessions will see all active players equipped with their own Lunaro so as to allow everyone the chance to practise basic game mechanics while waiting for additional loadings to join. Once a game is full and ready to begin the match will naturally progress to the proper Lunaro mode with goals, assists, and saves from the previous Warm-Up being wiped clear.\nMuch of the feedback we've received from our seasoned PvP players and newcomers alike was our inscrutable matchmaking rules. We've attempted to stream lines and have separated the rules used to match players in PvE from those used for PvP. Specifics on these PvP specific matchmaking rules are as follows:\nWhen attempting to join a friend you will be placed on their team if there is available space.\nIf you create a squad and then create/join a PvP lobby you will all be placed on the same team. Subsequent joiners will fill the opposing team slots.\nInviting a Friend who is currently in a squad will attempt to being in the full squad into your current game/lobby.\nAttempting to join a PvP match without enough space for you and your squad will now present an error message indicating that there isn't space to accommodate everyone.\nA similar error message to the above will be displayed when a full Squad of 4 players attempts to join a Lunaro match.\nInvite and Friends Only Lobbies now have a \"Switch Team\" option.\nAnother common gripe that has sometimes been affecting our competitive PvP modes was one that affects almost all games of this nature; rage quitters. While any system we introduce won't be able to completely solve this issue we've enacted a consequence system that will hopefully curb some of the more numerous instances:\nWe now track players who quit out of matches including those using the Alt-F4 method.\nThe Penalty system has 2 stages; a warning and a penalty applied state:\nThe warning stage will appear on the Landing Craft after the game detects that you've quit out of a match prematurely.\nThe Penalty Applied state will kick in after a certain % of your last games are determined to have been prematurely left. This state results in an XP Penalty of 75%.\nPlayer's can climb back out of the Penalty Applied state by completing a corresponding amount of full matches.\nWhile also negatively affecting rage quitters, we want to encourage those who continue to play while short on players and those who play multiple matches in a row.\nCompleting a match you were short on will result in a +20% boost to XP and Standing.\nCompleting subsequent matches will results in 10% more XP and Standing after the first match.\nWith the launch of Lunaro on Consoles we introduced full customization options for Lunaro controls. With this update we will be introducing the same functionality for PC keyboard and mouse users.\nHead over to the Options screen to configure your Lunaro bindings as you see fit!\nAnother major complaint directed toward our Conclave game modes has been the potential for laggy experiences due to the game running on our peer to peer system. With this update we will be rolling out the first stages of a potential solution to this issue: volunteer player hosted servers \nwe've got the tools in place to allow you to host Lunaro.\nAt this stage volunteer servers are limited to running Lunaro only, and require a separate dedicated computer to host.\nThe initial roll-out will be conducted via an invite-only process due to the need to gauge scalability and success. We will be using this soft launch to gather valuable feedback and stats and once we determine that the system is ready to provide the best experience we will be moving forward with a full scale public release.\nAffinity gained no longer converts to Energy in Conclave\nIncreased Standing gain at EOM based on Conclave Syndicate Rank\nShield regen delay decreased in Conclave\nShield regen rate

This is affected by Efficiency Mods. \nHealth orbs are no longer guaranteed drops from Desecrated corpses. They are now tied in with the chance for additional loot drops.\nThe number of Shadows spawned has been reduced to 7 and is no longer affected by Mods. This is a necessary change for performance on all platforms. To compensate for this, Nekros now spawns stronger Shadows prioritized by heavy unites killed with Shield multiplier and draw aggro more heavily. \nShadows now live until they die with Health decay over time that is affected by Duration instead of Strength. \nShadows of the Dead can be recast while active to spawn new Shadows to replace dead ones, and refill the Health/Shields of the current Shadows. \n*Recasting Shadows of the Dead will also teleport your Shadows to you within limits. (if they are >10m and <40m away)\nThe Shield of Shadows Augment has been reviewed to maintain efficacy with these changes.\n\nVaulted Relics will now appear in the Codex (ie: Relics that are not currently in circulation that you may own).\nThe Codex section for Relics and Arcanes will now show items you've discovered but don't own (like Mods do so you can see the drop sources to farm some more).\nTweaked the TennoGen Mesa Falcon Helmet tint.\nUpdated the TennoGen Rota Syandana materials.\nIncreased the brightness of the Guides of The Lotus Sigil.\nUpdated the Burston mesh in the Stalker diorama.\n",

With your suggestions and comments in place, we are continuing to tweak Void Fissures/Relics where necessary with the aim to reduce repetition issues and tie this mechanic into the lore of Warframe. The Void is an entity that corrupts, and Void Fissures are no different.\nThere is no longer just one 'Void Fissure', Void Fissures can occur again and again as the Void's corrupting energy tears through the Solar System. Fissures now spawn dynamically throughout the level near groups of enemies. The Fissure will corrupt any nearby enemies immediately after spawning. This buffs the enemy, and resets their health/shields. It will also spawn a couple Orokin units along with them, some being Eximus after a certain amount of Fissures. Fissures despawn after a period of time.\nThe corrupted and newly spawned Orokin units have a chance to drop Reactant, which are auto pickups (no more context action). Once you collect enough, you qualify for the Void Projection reward, and one of your weapons or your Warframe will be buffed for a short period of time based on Era of Void Relic brought. You will be given a random amount of Void Trace as well after collecting enough Reactant. Fissures will continue to spawn throughout the mission.\nVoid Traces cap is now Mastery Rank based (100 + 50 * MR).\nReactant marker now uses the Void Tear icon. The marker is only visible if players don't have enough Reactant.\nReactant uses a drop range (kill x amount for guaranteed drop) instead of drop chance.\n“Endless” Void Fissure missions are now truly endless with the exception of Defense and Interception. \nYour Equipped Relic information will now be shown in the Squad info dropdown box (where Equipped Dragon keys appears).\n*Traces are given when you get 10/10 Reactant (no relic needed) and rewarded at End of Mission (between a range of 6-30).\nFixed an issue with Conclave mods with the Max Energy requirement applying their upgrades twice to the Host.\nReduced melee blocking angle in Conclave.\nReduced channeled blocking energy cost in Conclave.\nAdjusted the attack order of the Spinning Palms Combo in Conclave Fist stance and slightly increased its damage.\nReduced the duration of Equinox's Metamorphosis in Conclave\n",

We've gone over every player ability and augment to provide predictable interactions with Nullifier bubbles and ability immune enemies. Below are the rules that we have adhered by to offer a consistent avenue for players to strategize against foes in-battle.\nAbilities will not affect players or enemies within a Nullifier bubble.\nEffects of an ability on both players and enemies will be removed when entering Nullifier bubbles.\nA Warframe’s active abilities will be deactivated upon entering a Nullifier bubble.\nProjectiles spawned by an ability will be deflected when they encounter a Nullifier bubble. For example, Ember’s Fireball and Ash’s Shuriken will be deflected.\nAbilities that exist independent of their creator will not be deactivated if the Warframe enters a nullifier, but will be destroyed if touched by the bubble itself. For example, Frost’s Snowglobe will not disappear when Frost enters the bubble, but will be destroyed if the bubble comes into contact with the Snowglobe sphere.\nAdjusted the enemy counts for each mission; in most cases the spawn counts were increased.\nImproved enemy tactics to better plan assaults on player-controlled towers; by staging units ahead of time they can be more effective and draw the action to different points around the map.\nChanged how the different types of enemy unit are sent into the fray. Historically you'd see higher-tier units mid-way through the first round and there would be no escalation after that; you should now see more infantry in the first round and then more support and heavy units if you chose to stay to intercept more transmissions.\nTuned the enemy tables to fix the cases where certain levels were 50% enemies that couldn't capture points (eg: Drones).\nCorrupted Vor in T4 Interception will no longer delay the end of round countdown (just the end of round) so that if he's the last enemy you aren't stuck waiting as long.\nFixed the problem where low-level Interception missions were flooded with Eximus’.\nAdded an Interception Mission to Sedna, Berehynia.\nSpoiler\nToxic Ancient's and Ancient Disrupter Auras will no longer stack with multiple Ancients of the same type.\nOberon’s Reckoning has a chance to make enemies drop health orbs which, when grabbed by you, heal your companions which revive them.\nFire rate Pistol mods will now affect Mesa's Peacemaker.\nAdded a PBR pass on materials for a variety of older Grineer and Infested levels.\nMade improvements to the spawn logic for Convergence pickups in Survival and Excavation missions.\nPhobos Tileset is now on Mars, and all Phobos missions are now on Asteroid Tileset.\nIncreased Dark Split-Swords Critical Chance while dual wielding by to 25% and Critical Multiplier to 2.5x.\nSlightly increased the Dark Split Sword dual wield attack speed.\nSlightly decreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade attack speed.\nIncreased the Dark Split Sword Heavy Blade  Element Damage to 90 and Status Chance to 25%\nIncreased the Twin Basolk Status Chance to 40% and increased Elemental damage to 65.\nSlightly Increased Twin Basolk attack speed.\nIncreased Twin Basolk Ground Slam damage by 4x , attack radius to 7.5m, and Status Chance to 65%.\nTwin Basolk Ground Slams can now ragdoll enemies.\nIncreased the amount of Impact damage done with Stradavar automatic fire while decreasing the Puncture and Slash damage these attacks do.\nIncreased the amount of Puncture damage done with Stradavar semi-automatic fire while decreasing the amount of Slash damage these attacks do.\nSlightly decreased the amount of damage done by Stradavar automatic fire and increased the amount of damage done by semi-automatic attacks.\nIncreased the Stradavar Status Chance to 15%.\nPolished the hit detection of melee weapons within Nullifier bubbles. Some weapons, like the Tonbo for example, would strike the Nullifier bubble first, followed by the Nullifier agent in the same strike. However, the damage would only result on the bubble! The weapons can now strike both the bubble and the agent on the same strike, and the agent will take damage as long you are inside the bubble for the attack.\nRemoved in-mission challenges for all Mastery rank tests.\nRemoved two small sections on Nyx Prime that were un-tintable.\nAdjusted the Market icon size of the Akstilleto and Ballistica.\nChanged the way lighting works on Sigils in an attempt tone down excessive bloom.\nSortie Missions can now have more environmental wrinkles, traps, and obstacles within. Stay Alert!\nMade improvements to the animation look and feel of thrown weapons while holding a Datamass.\nAs a result of wanting to reduce the amount of playerbase splitting that the Syndicate Mission rank generation created, we've reduced this to simply have 7 missions per Syndicate.\nAt Rank 1 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 1, 2, 3.\nAt Rank 2 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 2, 3, 4.\nAt Rank 3 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 3, 4, 5.\nAt Rank 4 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 4, 5, 6.\nAt Rank 5 in a given Syndicate, you get missions 5, 6, 7.\nAs a result, now you are more likely play with other members of the Syndicate at close ranks to you. You will still now have 3 Syndicate missions active in your World state menu, but you should now have more people do them with!\nWarframe Helmet blueprints are now labeled as ‘Neuroptics’. Please note that when trading components, full Warframe sets now contain Systems, Chassis, and Neuroptics (previously Helmet) as components.\nPolished a variety of environment materials that were too bright.\nPolished a variety of old tileset decoration placements and layouts.\nPlayers can now choice to cancel an undesired squad migration if the migration is occurring while in a lobby.\nUpdated certain interactable Orokin Derelict consoles with new meshes.\nImproved your Sentinels responsiveness to catching up to you and staying at shoulder level when you're moving quickly.\nRescue targets can now shoot while following players. Teleport actions will still take precedent over this behavior when making your way to extraction.\nReduced the Syndicate buff FX to help aiming visibiltiy as per:\nIncreased the spawn rate of Rare Crates in The Jordas Verdict to match the Law of Retribution.\nThe Archwing ability stat screen will now show the correct range for abilities depending on context. (E.g. Blink used to show 100m, but in space you are 0.25x scale so distances are effectively 4x as far. So in space Blink will now show 400m. In water ranges are reduced, so Blink will show 39.69m.)\nGave Rescue hostages their own (incredibly generous) cover evaluators so their cover findings don't conflict with their behaviour. Gave them larger vision range so they react to dangers behind / next to them and not just when they get shot by them first.\nImproved finisher hit detection for multiple weapons. Reticles will now flash red when a finisher can be performed and with each hit for multistrike finisher moves.\nMultistrike finisher moves will have their damage split amongst each hit instead of now being delivered all at the end.\nPropaganda Drone damage reduction buffs no longer stack.\nImproved jump detection. Before players could prematurely double jump when just about to fall off a ledge, when falling off a small edge, or when walking down a steep incline. Regular jumps will now be performed in these scenarios.\nImproved Dojo and Liset decoration placement code.\nVauban’s Bastille now works on Corpus air units. (Attack Drones, etc.)\nIncreased the drop rate of Automatic Trigger.\nIncreased the drop rate of Vermillion Storm.\nImproved squad merging code to better facilitate Lunaro matchmaking.\nImproved migration code to better handle migrations occurring during PvP team selection phase.\nArchwing augment mods now display an <ARCHWING> tag to help differentiate them.\nImprove the physics on the Ki Teer Syandana.\n\n",

Also, it will be clear to see which Missions you need to complete thanks to new Junctions -\nroutes between planets -\nguiding you on where to go next.\n \nWe've replaced and re-assigned many missions, including the removal of Deception and the not-so-popular Archwing Defense.\n \nDifficulty, planet progression, and enemy levels have been reassigned to better reflect the modern Solar System.\n \nDedicated memorials have been set up in Relays to display the names of contributing Founders!\n\nSpecters of the Rail live here \nyou must show you are worthy to conquer the Junction and ignite its Planetary travel power.\nJunctions link travel \nall players new and old must complete the Task list to activate the Junctions for progression and rewards.\nJunctions reward players with Mastery upon completion! Please note this Mastery reward is quite large, and offsets any Mastery points lost in the Star Chart changes of nodes per planet.\nVenus\nMercury Junction: Once Awake, Howl of the Kubrow\nEarth\nMars Junction: The Archwing\nMars\nPhobos Junction: Stolen Dreams\nJupiter\nEuropa Junction: The New Strange, Limbo Theorem Blueprint\nSaturn\nUranus Junction: Natah, Clem Quest\nUranus\nNeptune Junction: The Second Dream\nPluto\nSedna Junction: Hidden Messages Blueprint\nPluto\nEris Junction: Patient Zero Blueprint, The Jordas Precept Blueprint\n*Sands of Inaros Blueprint is still obtained from Baro Ki Teer.\n\nVoid Relic: Ancient Relics that react to Void Fissures to reveal treasures within.\nVoid Traces: Raw Void energy that drops in the process of uniting Relics and Fissures. Can be used to Refine Void Relics to yield more rare rewards in your Orbiter.\nReactant: Drops in missions and must be used in the Void Fissure sealing process.\nRefinement: The Process of improving the likelihood of Rare rewards from Void Relics.\nEra: An old Orokin age.\nLith / Meso / Neo / Axi: 4 Distinct Eras of the Orokin past, all suddenly manifesting through Void Fissures in the Solar Map.\nT1 Keys have turned into Lith Era Relics.\nT2 Keys have turned into Meso Era Relics.\nT3 Keys have turned into Neo Era Relics\nT4 Keys have turned into Axi Era Relics.\nVoid Relic Segment: Found on a Junction, used to Refine Void Relics.\nAfter years of new content releases and updated items to collect, there is a certain irony in calling the Void the “void”. Until Specters of the Rail, getting specific Prime parts was a repetitive and regimented process. Each Tower mission has a corresponding key and reward table, and if you want one of those rewards, you need to stock up on the appropriate key and repeat the same mission until you accomplish your goal. That all changes with the introduction of Relics. Instead of running the same mission repeatedly, Relics allow you to dynamically acquire the rewards you want by playing Fissure missions that appear on any planet, and there will always be Void Fissures active. Collecting cool rewards is a fundamental aspect of Warframe, and this new Void system is designed to make it more fun and immersive \nwith Void Fissures ripping into the very fabric of the Origin System!\n*Please note that Void Fissures will not be available for Assassinate and endless mission types \nexcluding Survival \nfor Launch. Further mission support will be coming shortly.\nRead the Developer Workshop here:\nSyndicate Void Key Pack has changed to Relic Pack.\nVoid Key Pack from the Market and Daily Tribute has changed to Relic Pack.\nAs for our good friend Baro, his sales/prices will be monitored closely to take new economy into account in terms of Ducat acquisition.\nAccess to the Derelicts is remaining the same.\nThe Refinement costs for improving an INTACT Void Relic are as follows:\nEXCEPTIONAL = 25 Void Traces\nFLAWLESS = 50 Void Traces\nRADIANT = 100 Void Traces\n\nSpoiler\nThis Update brings a huge change to the way our distance and obstruction sound works across all of Warframe. All distant sounds now feel properly spatialized and obstructed sounds now have the feeling of walls and more. Each shot, each character sound, each infested squeal will now bring you a more visceral and deep sound experience.\nWe updated many weapon sounds to have elements that take advantage of this new sound system.\nArchwing has been upgraded to a full six degrees of freedom! Now, you’ll be able to pilot your Archwing like a true flight simulator with full 360 degree yaws and pitches. (Note: submersible missions will still use the old controls)\nNew Archwing UI and control bindings to further enhance your flying experience!\nNew Eximus Archwing units have been deployed throughout the Origin System!\nSyndicates now offer Archwing components!\nReduced the total number of Archwing nodes to 8 \none of each type for Grineer and Corpus.\nArchwing Pursuit (Saturn \nPandora)\nHunt down a heavily defended Grineer Ship and destroy it by fighting through the ship’s defenses, such as: energy shields, turrets, and mines.\nArchwing Rush (Phobos \nKepler)\nReach hostile supply ships and destroy them before they escape. The more ships you destroy within the given time, the greater the reward.\nGet this Archwing today in the Market or Tenno Clan Research!\nThe Warframe Market got a facelift! Two big motivators behind this rework are pretty straight-forward: a) to make it easier to find what you want and to see what’s available; and b) to allow the Market to grow as more content is added in-game. Highlights of this upgrade include better item categories (especially for Cosmetics) and a brand new search function to help you fine-tune your results. A new hide/show owned button will make browsing for new gear a breeze, but for those who need to save up for the big ticket items, the new Wishlist feature will help you keep track of your must-haves. Feeling particularly generous? You can see your friends’ Wishlists and gift them what their heart desires!\nA large majority of Market-related complaints we receive relate to the confusion between built items (aka Platinum-purchased) and Blueprints. The current Market set-up can misguide players into thinking that Warframes, Weapons, and Sentinels aren’t craftable in-game, so we condensed the Built items and Blueprints into the same page. Information about build costs, stats, blueprint location, and more, will be separated into 3 tabs on this page to help players learn all they need to know about the item in order to make an informed purchase!\n\nWhile trying to make the Market work (and look!) better, we made some pricing changes as follows:\nFrugal Credits Bundle: 50k Credits for 50 Platinum.\nHigh Roller Credit Bundle: 175k Credits for 90 Platinum.\nLoki*: 175 Platinum\nMag*: 75 Platinum\n* These prices were swapped to reflect the change in Starter status.\nSpoiler\nFixed doors locking if a player enters and exits the

The squad UI now shows who is in range with the Tenno Affinity marker.\nFixed Trinity’s Blessing dealing a possible infinite damage multiplier.\nValkyr Changes:\n\nHysteria: Each kill reduces her Hysteria Aura by 1 meter, the aura will continue to grow but killing frequently will keep it tight around you so you can control its range.\nMag Changes & Fixes\n\nImproved the FX of Mag’s Polarize.\nFixed Mag’s Crush FX not playing properly for Clients. \nFixed Mag’s Magnetize bubble being invisible when inside it.\nFixed Mag dealing self-damage with Magnetize.\nEnemy Plasma Grenade Changes\n\nBefore Plasma Grenades explode, they will live for 3 seconds after coming to a rest on the ground.\nPlasma Grenades can now be shot in air or when they are on the ground. \nWhen an enemy Plasma Grenade is shot and killed, it will explode and damage any enemies in range with no damage to you.

  "changes": "Hotfix 18.5.4:\nUpdate 18.5 contained a change made to ensure that enemies will no longer spawn in areas that have been cleared, as long as the level is not on alert.  This change was made to help prevent an exploit that caused enemies to rapidly spawn in the same room only to be instantly killed by stealthed players, and these enemies never scaled.  This was limited mostly to Deception Missions, but was present in Sabotage, Mobile Defense or Spy Missions as well.\nEnemies will now spawn in areas not yet seen by players.  This will allow players to clear rooms stealthily, while avoiding enemies spawning behind players and potentially ruining any stealth runs.  ‘Alerted’ enemies will spawn nearby and out of sight, but can also spawn in rooms already seen by players.\nThese changes will not affect enemy spawning in Exterminate, Excavation, Survival or Defense Missions, but will have a slight impact on enemy spawning on other Mission types.\n•    Loot Crates obtained in the Orokin Moon tileset puzzle rooms will no longer play rare Loot Crate audio FX which mislead players. \n•    Improved the lighting FX displaying on Squad ships seen outside the player’s Landing Craft.\n•    Removed item drops from Mastery Rank 4 survival test.\n•    Removed redundant Empty Relay Instances\n•    Cleaned up Kubrow barks and breathing.\n•    Chat is now enabled in 'Vendor Mode' in Maroo's Bazaar. \n•    The Provoked Mod now affects Inaros's bleed out damage.\n",

Please be conscious that some areas may appear overly or underlit. We will work to fix up any rough looking spots \nfeel free to send screenshots are way in bug threads throughout the appropriate subforums.\nWith Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.\nLighting textures have been reengineered to reduce square compression artifacts and ugly color banding. You may have seen me point this out on past Devstreams.         \nAll PBR materials have been recompressed with a more accurate format, new and subtle details are visible on your PBR'd Warframes, gear and in the environment.             \nReflection Probes have been built through many areas of the game, grounding PBR materials with more accurate lighting.        \nCharacter and weapon lighting includes more accurate 'dual specular' lighting which means metallic surfaces are more realistic and fancy looking.      \nHDR rendering has been switched to a compact 32bit format which has improved HDR rendering performance for a wide range of GPUs.               \nTonemapping has been adjusted to use more of the range of lighting content in the game, images have more detail, particularly richer in the darks.        \nMotion Blur and Depth of Field have been re-engineered to run faster and look better, fast moving and defocused objects no longer appear 'cut out' on their silhouettes.          \nDraw order optimizations have been applied to every object in the game, which improves overall performance, particularly in worst-case scenarios.          \nAtmospheric fog effects are now rendering in a separate lighting pass, allowing richer particle effects at distance without being 'erased' by atmosphere.              \nParticle lighting has been improved to more accurately represent the local lighting environment.         \nWind force modelling on many particle systems increase realism as various environmental particles now respond to explosive forces and Warframe powers – you've also probably seen us showcase this in our most recent Devstream.         \nBloom system has been softened and made more seated in the scene. The burnt-out look is replaced with a more subtle and gentle sci-fi glow.         \nPhysics collision, performance and stability have all been improved, as a long-awaited upgrade of Warframe PhysX libraries has been completed.\nInterception AI Improvements\nEnemies in Interception Missions have been overhauled to help improve the flow of combat over the course of the Mission.  These improvements include:\nSuperior objective finding and hacking agent selection.\nBetter player tracking and more intuitive movement to Squad location.\nEnemies unable to hack (such as MOAs) will no longer move to engage hacking consoles.\nConclave Changes & Additions\nRecruit Conditioning has been enabled for all players who are Rank 0-2 with the Conclave Syndicate:\nPlayers who are Rank 0-2 will be matched together in matchmaking.\nEffects from Rare mods are disabled in Recruit matches.\nThis option is turned on by default and can be turned off in the Conclave Liset Console if you want to join matches with Rank 3+ players.\nThe option is disabled and removed for players who are Rank 3+ with the Conclave Syndicate.\nNew Annihilation and Team Annihilation Conclave Map: Orokin

  "changes": "Update 17: Echoes Of The Sentient:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's never been a better time to be a space ninja. Echoes of the Sentient is here!\n\nThere is so much to explore in this massive, new update! Move through the Solar System in an entirely new way with a completely overhauled Parkour system. Visit an underwater world with new Archwing levels. Go on a Quest for the new Equinox Warframe and discover the best of both worlds. Experience an abundance of new Conclave additions, Weapons, Mods and more!\n\n\nIs the strange drone scanning Tenno just an ungraded piece of Corpus technology or are there more sinister things stirring in the Origin System?\n\n\nThe mystery drone will randomly seek out players with a mastery rank of 3 or higher. After encountering this drone, the Lotus will initiate the quest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit between day and night, Equinox manifests aggressive and defensive forms at will.  Equinox’s powers include:\n\n\n\nThis complete overhaul of Warframe’s parkour system brings a dramatic change to one of Warframe’s core elements: movement.  With these changes players will be given true freedom of movement without limitations such as being required to use specific weapons or becoming locked into restrictive animations.\n\nPlayers will be given a quick tutorial of the changes made in Parkour 2.0 when logging in for the first time after the Update is live.  Players can choose to skip this tutorial, or replay it from the Advanced Movement menu in the Training section of the Codex.\n\nThe following features have been added to Warframe’s movement system:\n\n\nChroma's green energy perk now gives a buff to holster and reload speed instead of affecting Stamina.\nMods that previously affected Stamina have now been converted to the appropriate amount of Fusion Core.\nAll Alternate Helmets that had Stamina-related effects have been given new abilities:\nArcane Chorus Helmet \nThis helmet is worn by Banshee, and adds Power Efficiency, but reduces duration of Aim Glide and Wall Latch.\nArcane Flux Helmet \nThis helmet is worn by Nova, and increases duration of Aim Glide and Wall latch, but reduces Health.\nArcane Storm Helmet \nThis helmet is worn by Volt, and increases Power Strength, but reduces duration of Aim Glide and Wall Latch.\nArcane Gambit Helmet \nThis helmet is worn by Vauban, and increases velocity of parkour maneuvers, with a reduction to Power Duration.\nArcane Scorpion Helmet \nThis helmet is worn by Ash, increases duration of Aim Glide and Wall Latch while sacrificing Power Efficiency.\nArcane Menticide Helmet \nThis helmet is worn by Nyx, increases velocity of parkour maneuvers with a drain on Shields.\n\n\nUranus Mission nodes have been given a total overhaul with the new Grineer Underwater Lab tileset.  With this expansion come unique Missions that require players to swap back and forth between their Archwing in order to access (and traverse) the hostile underwater environment that has kept these labs hidden for so long.  Players must have an equippable Archwing in order to access these Missions.\n\n\n\nPlayers will be able to unlock Exilus Slots for their Warframes, which provides an additional Utility Mod slot that players can use to further customize their loadouts.  Once unlocked players can use any Utility Mod in the Exilus Mod slot. Please note we have designated several mods as 'Utility' for this purpose.  The list of existing mods designated as Utility includes:\n\nHandspring\nMaglev\nRush\nShock Absorbers\nSure Footed\nEnemy Sense\nHeavy Impact\nIntruder\nMaster Thief\nAviator\nThief’s Wit\nRetribution\nWarm Coat\n\nThe following new Mods have been designated 'Utility':\n\nTraveller\nFirewalker\nLightning Dash\nIce Spring\nToxic Flight\nPatagium\nBattering Maneuver\nRending Walk\nPiercing Flight\n\nExilus Mod slots can be unlocked using an item found in Simaris' offerings after completing the Quest: Natah, or can be purchased for 20 Platinum.\n\n\nThe following enemies have been added to the Uranus tileset, featuring unique visual appearance to match their aquatic environment.  Their powers and abilities are identical to their military counterparts found elsewhere in the Grineer Empire:\nDrekar Lancer\nDrekar Elite Lancer\nDrekar Scorpion\nDrekar Trooper\nDrekar Butcher\nDrekar Hellion\nDrekar Ballista\nDrekar Heavy Gunner\nDrekar Eviscerator\nThe following enemies are unique to Archwing submersible portions of Uranus tileset Missions:\nDraga \nUses a deadly harpoon gun to snare and damage his enemies.\nDarek Draga \nDeploys disruptive ink clouds.\nShock Draga \nUtilizes a taser cord.\nSikula \nDeploys aquatic mines.\nManic Bombard: Highly mobile heavy artillery\nBlunt: Portable protection against weapons fire.\nRampart: A turret armed with twin, double-barrel cannons.\n\n\nKulstar \nRain hell on the enemy with this handheld cluster-rocket launcher.\nHarpak \nSpike enemies to the wall or reel them in with this automatic harpoon gun.\nGrattler \nShatter your targets with explosive shells from this devastating Archwing cannon.\nAck & Brunt \nTyl Regor’s custom axe and shield are how he likes to eliminate ‘frustrations’.\nTwin Grakata \nWhen one Grakata isn't enough, bring another for extra firepower.\n\n\nThe following Mods are Transmutable and will also appear in purchased booster packs (with exception to Depleted Reload, which is a Corrupted Mod):\n\n\n\nThe following list represents changes that have been made to some of Warframe’s game modes.  Unless otherwise specified these changes apply to the Mission type across all tilesets.\n\nAdded more defendable console locations.\nConsole defense time will now scale with Mission difficulty.\nThere are now 2-3 consoles per Mission, with total defense time divided between the number of available consoles.\nConsole health now scales with the number of consoles available in a Mission.\nThe total number of enemies that will spawn to attack consoles has been reduced.\n\nCapture levels now have a single target following a longer escape route.\nCapture targets now have increased health and special abilities.\nCapture targets can now initiate lockdowns if they reach a room without any players.\nNew capture targets have been added to this game mode.\n\nWaves will now start with weaker enemies, progressing to support units and ending with heavy and Eximus units to make the end of the wave more intense.\nThe number of enemies attacking the player has been increased for early-waves and decreased for later-waves;

With this change we will monitor power use across each Warframe to ensure that every form of crowd control is given fair play against enemies, whether the Ability is timer-based or relies on energy drain.\n\n\nThe Amaru Chroma Helmet and Ovis Mesa Helmet are now available in the marketplace!\n\n\nFixed the Kubrow using the wrong finisher on enemies.\nFixed the Kubrow’s finisher animation on the Drahk Master making the victim immune to outside damage for the duration of the animation.\nFixed issue that would occur when using Mirage’s Eclipse that would prevent the player from using this Ability, or other powers, again.\nFixed ugly textures that would display on some Grineer doors.\nFixed Nekros’ Soul Survivor Augment not properly tracking revives or counting towards revive challenges as per: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/443040-nekros-soul-survivor-does-not-count-as-a-revive/\nFixed issue that would cause player’s map to break when trying to type during Ash’s Bladestorm animation.\nFixed a possible issue that caused windowed versions of Warframe to show a blank screen when the game is restarted after a crash.\nFixed players losing duplicate Arcane Helmets after trading one of the helmets.\nFixed an issue that would occur during an enemy ragdoll, causing a crash.\nFixed some instances where terrain would inappropriately meld into another room.\nFixed placement of hints during Simaris’ Scanning tutorial.\nFixed Chroma’s Effigy moving when in electric water or similar environmental hazards.\nFixed the Dojo Polychrome Bot being unable to be removed after placement, or potentially being able to be placed in an area that cannot be reached.\nFixed an issue that would not properly refund Platinum to the Clan Vault if a room painted via Polychrome that was rushed is destroyed.\nFixed issue that would cause knee-slide audio done by Clients to play for the Host anywhere on the map.\nFixed some instances of AMD driver crashes that would occur when minimizing Warframe.\nFixed an issue that would occur when timing out in the Dojo, causing the game to crash.\nFixed an issue that would show Kubrows and Sentinels as wearing two badges.\nFixed Mesa’s Longhorn helmet not properly reflecting energy color.\nFixed AI pathing so that enemies no longer get stuck on pillars in the second phase of the Law of Retribution.\nFixed the minimap occasionally breaking in some rooms on the Grineer Galleon tileset.\nFixed players having Primary and Secondary weapons unequipped after completing the tutorial.\nFixed Darvo’s VO not playing in the second mission in Vor’s Prize.\nFixed an issue where weapon skins were not displaying properly on login.\nFixed audio effects not properly going off when players capture a Cephalon in Cephalon Capture.\nFixed some broken water physics that would occur in the Orokin Void tileset.\nFixed an issue that would prevent Clients from being able to complete a Corpus Sabotage Mission after a Host Migration.\nFixed Arcane HUD indicators from showing as though they were debuffs from a Dragon Key.\nFixed a crash that would occur when fighting Sargas Ruk in melee.\nFixed Clients that get knocked down appearing as though they are sliding to Hosts and other Clients.\nFixed error that would allow Punch Through Mods to create unlimited multishot when a weapon is fired through Volt’s Electric Shield.\nFixed players being able to get stuck under elevators on the Corpus Ice Planet.\nFixed MK1-Furis showing a price of 120 Platinum in the Market.\nFixed players showing as having default skins and colors when in a Relay.\nFixed issue where Clan Emblems would not show up until after logging in.\nFixed Uru and Pyro Sugatras not appearing properly on some weapons.\nFixed an issue that caused Lephantis to become invisible and immune to damage.\nFixed some water clipping through textures on Earth Defense tilesets.\nFixed a typo in the Patient Zero Quest line.\nFixed some grammatical errors in the Codex description of Defense Missions.\nFixed localization descriptions on Lephantis Nav Coordinates, they now refer to Lephantis instead of Golem.\nFixed default colors on a Warframe not displaying properly in the Codex diorama.\nFixed Kubrows who had their appearances altered in a previous Update.\nFixed Clients being unable to pick up Void Key in Void Sabotage Missions after killing the miniboss.\nFixed held melee attacks being usable in mid-air, causing a ‘gliding slam’ onto an area.  Slam attacks will now drop players directly to the ground.\n",

The following changes have been made to help create and maintain that equilibrium:\n\nSlide attacks in PvP will now only use the base damage of the melee weapon wielded. Previously, slide attacks used a damage multiplier; this was shifting the balance in a negative direction.\nRhino’s Iron Skin is no longer a permanent buff, and will begin to slowly decay after a short period of time.\nMade adjustments to Rhino’s Charge damage in PvP.\nArcane Helmets have been removed from PvP.\nMods that increase maximum clip size may now be used in PvP.\nIncreased DPS for all Primary and Secondary weapons in PvP.\nIncreased the damage of Frost’s Freeze ability in PvP.\nIncreased the range of Mag’s Pull ability in PvP.\nIncreased the amount of overshield from Mag’s Shield Polarize ability in PvP.\nReduced the damage of Volt’s Shock ability in PvP.\nReduced the damage of all Paris bows in PvP.\n\nPvP Changes\n\nUpdated water effects in Orokin Cephalon Capture level.\nRespawning Cephalons now play a sound on respawn.\nThe Gear wheel has been removed from the Conclave Arsenal menu.\n\nChanges\n\nBuilding Arcane Enhancements now costs 200k credits.\nGave Rhino’s Stomp a slight audio boost.\nRemoved dead animation time at the end of Excalibur’s Radial Javelin and radial Blind casting animations.\nTweaked various defenses in Corpus Spy vaults.\nTweaked various defenses in Grineer Spy vaults.\nAmbulas has been removed from the Sanctuary Simulacrum.\nMultiple items can now be purchased at once from the Syndicate Market UI.\nIncreased timers in Grineer Spy vaults.\nMade various environmental PBR updates to the Orokin Void and Tenno Dojo.\nIncreased the brightness of flames produced by the Ignis.\nImproved the smokey particle effects on the Embolist’s weapon fire.\nPlayers without a Synthesis Scanner equipped during a scan will no longer receive Synthesis progress.\nEnergy orbs worth 50 energy are now larger than orbs worth 25 energy.\nMade various localization updates.\nAdded casting trails on Nekros’ abilities.\n\nFixes\n\nFixed Warframes not holding a weapon in the Melee training portion of the Codex\nFixed issue causing players to respawn players with 100% health after Host migration in PvP\nFixed the Grineer Manic’s animations not properly deactivating Warframe powers, giving him unintended power immunity pre-attack.  Tackles from the Grineer Manic will now properly disable Warframe powers as intended.\nFixed Chroma’s Spectral Scream being affected by rift status.\nFixed Chroma’s Elemental Ward fire AoE being affected by rift status.\nFixed lighting effects on glowing MOA spawners in Corpus Spy vaults.\nFixed issue in Spy missions where failing the main console hack would cause the ‘data destruction’ timer to stop and be unusable for the remainder of the Mission.\nFixed players being unable to parry the Grineer Heavy Gunner’s melee slam.\nFixed being able to use 8-player squads in other non-Trial Missions.\nFixed players being able to bypass Conclave loadouts by joining Cephalon Capture via invite or entering a match via the Join in Progress button.\nFixed a light not properly casting shadows in the Grineer Spy vault.\nFixed Chroma’s Noble animations displaying a strange hand positioning.\nFixed Bo Prime not being usable in PvP.\nFixed Sanctuary’s Mastery Test practice simulations giving Credit rewards.\nFixed login error caused by conflicting update versions tagged on an account.\nFixed Chroma’s elemental Ward not properly removing ‘old’ buff when 2+ Chroma activate the ability.\nFixed an issue where players who once equipped mustaches will still have mustaches equipped when changing weapon skins within the Liset.\nFixed certain texture in CTF Gas City Map that was causing interaction issues.\nFixed accounts that had lost their loadout information upon logging in.\nFixed loadout error that could occur in PvP Arsenal.\nFixed item drops appearing from enemies in Sanctuary Simulacrum.\n",

Relays during Eyes of Blight, the Lotus will guide a precision strike force to hunt down and put an end to Vay Hek once and for all.  Be wary Tenno.  Numbers alone will not protect you when diving into the heart of Grineer military power.\n\nCreate a squad of 4 to 8 Tenno and work through three challenge scenarios as you track down Vay Hek across the Solar System.\nEarn Arcane enhancements from defeating Vay Hek, each of which provide a unique bonus Warframes can unleash during combat.\nIn order to equip an Arcane enhancement players must construct it in their Foundry under the Miscellaneous tab.\nPlayers will then need to select what Helmet or Syandana they would like the Arcane to be attached to.\nAfter construction the Arcane Helmet or Arcane Syandana will appear in their Arsenal under Attachments.\nThe Law of Retribution Key Blueprint is available for purchase in the marketplace for 100,000 Credits.\nThis Mission can be completed with a minimum of 4 Tenno for an additional challenge.  Enemies will not scale down in difficulty with fewer players present in the Mission.\n\nCephalon Capture is our latest PvP game mode available on the Conclave Console in the Liset, and

can access their unique Conclave loadouts from the Arsenal by selecting ‘Select Mode’, followed by ‘Conclave’.\nCephalon Capture has three maps on launch that will rotate between rounds!\nCephalon Capture now features Challenges that can be unlocked while fighting against your fellow Tenno.\nWith our expansion to PvP 2.0 comes a new figure to guide Tenno through the Conclave’s trials and toward the path of enlightenment.  Teshin, a survivor of the Orokin Era, disagrees with the Lotus’ policies and strives to see Tenno break free of that which restrains their potential.\n\nTeshin and the Conclave Syndicate have established their presence in the Northern Wing of any Relay, and offer unique Syndicate rewards for Tenno who represent Teshin when participating in Conclave PvP.\n\nIn the cradle of space on Tenno Relays across the Solar System Cephalon Simaris has constructed a Sanctuary with the goal of eternally preserving all life.  But Simaris needs your help, Tenno.  Using Simaris’ advanced Synthesis Scanner you must track down unique targets to scan in a Codex shared by Tenno all over the world, and help unlock exciting new lore and Syndicate rewards.\nSimaris is a Neutral Syndicate and can be joined by any Tenno regardless of current Syndicate allegiance.\nSynthesis Scanners can be equipped like regular Gear, and are used in the same fashion a Codex scanner

After a couple years of talk, we finally were able to set up a Test cluster which could be accessed externally. This Test cluster housed the many iterations of Update 16 content.\n\nFor 1 week straight leading up to this update, a group of just under 20 veteran Tenno spent hours and hours each day playing together, giving feedback, finding bugs, and voicing concerns. Each day included tireless attempts at the incredibly difficult Raids, hilarious moments competing in PvP, and general exploration of all things new. This past week has been one for the memory books \nabout 60+ hours together with veteran Tenno who applied their skill to some of our hardest and most surprising content yet. I loved every minute of it, and I can’t wait to see what we can do for quality with the potential that this Test cluster has opened!\nRebecca\n",

  "changes": "Tenno Reinforcements:\n\n\n\nAkjagara Dual Pistols and Uru Sugatra available now!\n\nThe design of these hard-hitting dual pistols is a mix of organic and bladed elements.\n\nExpressing the martial finesse and skill of its master, the Uru Sugatra complements the Uru Syandana used in the Tenno Absolution Ceremony.\n\nGet these new in-game additions by visiting the Market today!\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the Arcane Codices?\n\nA new character and a completely revamped version of Spy Mode await you in the Stolen Dreams Quest. Embrace your inner secret agent, Tenno!\n\nThe Grineer have put out a capture order for a thief named Maroo – they claim she double crossed them and has sold precious Arcane Codices to the Corpus. Concerned for Maroo’s safety – and excited at the idea of a new Arcane Codex – the Lotus is requesting that you bring Maroo in.\n\nThink fast, Tenno! You must plan your actions quickly and accordingly in this Quest. Failure to do so may alert the enemy to your presence and the Arcane Codex data may be destroyed.\n\nComplete this Quest and you’ll be rewarded with an Ether Dagger Blueprint and a Catalyst Blueprint.\n\nThis new Quest is available for all players Mastery Rank 3 or greater.\n\n\nWhile our old Spy game mode certainly had small spy-like focus in stealing intel, most of the time players were happy to loudly murder their way through the enemy to get the job done.  Who could blame anyone?  That’s why we sat down and gave Spy a total overhaul.\n\nWith new elements focused on avoiding laser grids and sneaking past guards, stealth is paramount in Spy 2.0.  Being detected will mean losing rewards and bonus Affinity, even when the Mission is complete.\n\nThe following nodes have been updated to include this new Spy game mode:\n\nMercury \nSuisei\nVenus \nVesper, Unda\nMars \nMartialis\nJupiter \nAdrastea\nSaturn \nTitan, Aegaeon\nUranus \nUmbriel, Rosalind\nNeptune \nSao, Laomedeia\nPluto \nOceanum\nCeres \nLex, Hapke\nEris \nCyath, Gnathos\nSedna \nTikoloshe, Scylla\nEuropa \nArmaros, Valac\nPhobos \nGrildrig, Shklovsky\n\n\nJoining our updated Spy 2.0 are some exciting improvements to stealth combat!  Players will now find that sneaking around each Mission may come with some excellent rewards.  These alterations to stealth gameplay will continue to evolve based upon player feedback, but for now stealth aficionados can sink their teeth into the following changes:\n\n\n\nWe’ve made a wide variety of improvements to Warframe in some obvious, and not-so-obvious ways.  The following is a quick list of changes we’ve made, and where you’ll notice them the most!\n\n\n\nThe following Mission Nodes on the Star Chart have had missing and mismatched rewards fixed.\n\nCeres \nBode (Capture)\nPhobos \nLimtoc, Todd (Capture)\nUranus \nTrinculo (Capture)\nEuropa \nValefor (Excavation)\nEuropa \nZagan, Morax (Exterminate)\nEris \nViver (Hive)\nSedna \nUndine (Sabotage)\nEuropa \nGamygyn (Sabotage)\nIn addition, changes have been made for Defense, Survival, Mobile Defense, Exterminate and Rescue.  Previously these Missions were not properly balanced to reflect the Mission's enemy levels, sometimes resulting in fewer enemies than intended in higher level Missions and more at lower level Missions.\n\n\nTo simulate waves and grouped up enemies, previously survival enemy spawns cycled on and off for short periods of time.  While it was a simple way of adding the desired pacing, we found that it was possible for players to get 'in sync' with killing enemies at certain times which left gaps of time where there were no enemies to kill and no enemies spawning, especially in higher level Missions with four players.\n\nSpawning now fluctuates dynamically with each enemy spawned.  Max spawn rate is the same, but it's now the time between individual enemy spawns which changes instead of a blanket 'on' or 'off' state for all enemy spawning.  Hopefully you will start to see more consistent spawning in higher level Missions with four players, as well as squads of enemies attacking together.  In our tests we found that there wasn't a notable difference in low level Missions.\n\nSmall life support drop rate was tweaked to compensate for the changes.\nAlthough we have playtested extensively, we are always interested in your feedback.  Please be sure to let us know how these changes may have affected your gameplay experience in the appropriate subforum: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/forum/237-mission/\n\nStar Chart node changes have been made to balance the available nodes across factions, tilesets and difficulty.  The following nodes have received changes:\n\nSaturn \nKeeler: Changed Survival node to Grineer Asteroid Mobile Defense\nSaturn\n Cassini: Changed to Asteroid tileset (was Galleon)\nPhobos \nFlimnap: New Survival Grineer Asteroid node (was Deception)\nEuropa \nZagan: New Survival Corpus ship (was Exterminate)\nNeptune \nDespina: New Survival Corpus ship (was Defense)\nCeres \nNuovo: Changed to Galleon tileset (was Shipyards tileset)\n\n\nShields and HP are two critical elements to keep track of in Warframe, but when fighting enemies it can be difficult to keep track of how much damage you’ve taken in the heat of combat.  This Update contains new visual and audio cues for when your Warframe takes damage in combat.\n\nWhen taking damage in combat damage will sound different depending on if your shields are down or intact.  Additionally shields ‘breaking’ have a new audio cue to help you better keep track of when your health is exposed to enemy fire.\n\nAdditional Sound Adjustments\n\nThis Update includes multiple improvements to sound immersion.  Among these changes are:\n\n·         Improved audio on bullet impact, making it easier to hear where shots as passing by (or where your rounds are being spent).\n·         Improvements to the Grakata's audio.\n·         Sliding will now provide different sound effects, depending on what surface the player is on.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of variables that go into making an NPC more or less deadly, and accuracy plays a huge role in what enemies are most feared.  These new adjustments to enemy accuracy will dramatically change how players handle foes.\n\nEach enemy will have increased (or decreased) odds of hitting a player based on the type of weapon they’re using.  Sniper rifles, for example, will have higher accuracy at long range but will be more difficult for NPCs to use in close-range combat.  Not only that, but our new system allows us to create custom draw rates that make some weapons more difficult for enemies to aim quickly with.\n\nThese changes represent an ongoing state of development for our NPC accuracy; and we welcome player feedback on this subtle, under-the-hood change to be made in the appropriate subforum.  For more information on our accuracy adjustments please check the following thread in our Developer Workshop: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/395422-npc-accuracy/\n\n\nSaryn’s Molt will now transfer enemies that ‘latch on’ to Warframes (Brood Mother Maggots, Swarm Moa Swarms, etc) instead of destroying them.\nOberon’s Hallowed Ground will no longer create a second AoE effect on a second cast when the Hallowed Eruption Mod is equipped.\nCasting Frost’s Snow Globe inside of a Snow Globe you previously created will combine the health of both globes, eliminating the old Globe in the process. This will allow for greater combat visibility as your view won’t be obscured by opaque stacked Snow-Globe walls!\nFrost Prime’s Ice Wave now has a bit of Prime flair to its visual effect.\nMag Prime’s Crush now has a bit of Prime flair to its visual effect.\nIncreased damage bonus to Excalibur’s Furious Javelin Mod.\nUpdated audio and visual FX on Volt’s Shock Ability.  \nThe following Augment Mods have had their duration increased from 24 seconds to 40 seconds, and their damage reduced from 125% to 100%\nEmber's Fireball Frenzy\nFrost’s Freeze Force\nOberon’s Smite Infusion\nSaryn’s Venom Dose\nVolt’s Shock Trooper\nNova’s Neutron Star Augment now has a max  range of 8 meters, in addition to some slight camera shake for effect.\nMade minor visual and audio FX changes to Frost’s Avalanche ability.\nRemoved the initial radial damage of Ember’s Fire Blast, damage and the Heat proc now occur on the shockwave as it expands.\nRemoved the white flash that occurs when transitioning into Loki’s Invisibility.\nSyndicate Medallions have been increased to provide 500, 1000 or 5000 Standing depending on Medallion rarity.\n\n\nItzal Archwing’s Support Drones will now gain the same color tints of the Archwing.\nThe ‘bounce’ effect that occurs when hitting an object has been reduced.  This should help eliminate any pinballing when hitting a wall in close-quarters.\n\n\nAuto-turrets will now be open on spawn.\nAdded health bars to Wyrmius bosses.\n\n\nSyndicate Daily Quests for Standing have received an Affinity overhaul!  These changes should make Syndicate Missions much more rewarding to complete, in addition to decreasing the Daily Syndicate Standing Cap for non-Syndicate missions.\n\nSyndicate Daily Missions now give double the Standing they did previously.\nDaily Standing caps for non-Syndicate missions for have been reduced by half (remember, this cap is determined by Mastery Rank).  For example:\nMR 0 could earn 2000 Standing before, now 1000.\nMR 1 could earn 4000 Standing before, now 2000.\nMR 2 could earn 6000 Standing before, now 3000.\nSyndicate Mission Medallions have new standing values:\nCommon Medallions are now worth 500 Standing\nUncommon Medallions are now worth 1000 Standing\nRare Medallions are still worth 5000 Standing\n\n\nThe following changes have been made to the Rakta Ballistica.  Future adjustments may continue to be made, and feedback on any weapon are encouraged to be posted in the appropriate subforum.\n\nRakta Ballistica’s crit chance has been buffed from 15 to 20 on charge.\nRatka Ballistica’s damage on charge has been changed to 5 Slash, 5 Impact, 90 Puncture.\n\n\nLighting adjustments have been made to Tenno Relays.\nVarious art updates have been made to Tenno Relays.\nReduced the number of locked co-op doors in the Corpus Gas City tileset for Rescue and Intel game types.\nThe Tar-Mutalist Moa, Sapping Osprey and Infested Alad V will now have their damage scale based on their level.\nImprovements have been made to glass and distortion effects in game!\nSinister Reach will now extend the Amprex’s chain lightning effect.\nUpdated sound effects on player and NPC footsteps.\nThe Lynx is now immune to Mind Control effects.\nMade various background art updates to Corpus Archwing Sabotage and Exterminate Missions.\nUpdated the Deep Freeze Mod to give up to 90% Freeze damage to match other elemental Mods.\nUpdated the North Wind and Shocking Touch Mods to give up to 90% damage to match other elemental Mods.\nAttempting to convert an Arcane Helmet will now display a warning message to confirm your decision.\nUpdated Natural Talent to now be a Rare Mod on Interception drop tables.\nAdjusted Ducat selling price of common Prime Parts from 50 to 10.\nIncreased the amount of Fusion Cores you get in Void Survival Rewards depending on tier of Survival being played.\nAdded a 3 x Orokin Cells to TIII Survival Rewards.                                                                                             \nSome Mission Ndes have been changed to the Grineer Galleon tileset (previously, Grineer Asteroid).\nThe bloom on Mutalist Incursion Tactical Alert Badges has been reduced.\nReduced particle effect trails for Kohm’s projectiles.\nPlayer HUD and targeting reticule will no longer display in Relays.\nWall running instructions in the beginning tutorial should now be easier to read and see.\nMission Extraction cinematics will now cancel all emotes and actions.\nVarious NPC changes have been made within Syndicates, adding more life to those who live there.\nNightmare Mode nodes now have an updated Icon on the Star Chart.\nMade audio improvements to Mission Transmissions.\nAdjusted the Kohm to shoot a maximum of 5 pellets, in addition to dropping the fire rate but boosting projectile damage to compensate for dps.  This should keep the Kohm’s damage relatively unchanged, while helping cut down on the graphical latency caused by the weapon.\nThe World State Window will now show quests that you can start, in addition to incomplete quests.\nAdded large viewing screens to the Relay Concourse.  \nNew Rescue Mission on Jupiter.\nPhobos Rescue tile was reworked for Rescue 2.0.\nRescue hostages will now stick closer to players, instead of moving at their own pace.\nRebalanced the MK1 Paris easier to use with comparable damage to the MK1 Braton.  \nVoid Mobile Defense maps have been reduced in size to cut down on the amount of travel Tenno need to do.\nSlightly reduced the Shield Osprey’s beam radius.\nRemoved puddle of water that would occur around ice floor panel in Void tilesets.\n\n",

We have just detected a Balor Fomorian traveling on an interception course with Vesper Relay. The beast moves slowly but if we allow it to get within firing range, it will surely obliterate our new Relay. We need to destroy it before that happens.\nIntelligence reports state that the Balor Fomorian’s power core emits a thick energy field composed of deadly omega radiation. In order to break through the field you will need to craft this Fomorian Disruptor. It will allow you to safely approach the core and when activated it will temporarily disrupt the core allowing you to inflict damage.\nTake note Tenno, the Disruptor is forged using recently discovered Omega Isotopes. These are a by-product of a Fomorian’s core and will only appear in and around planets with a Fomorian present.\nMove quickly Tenno, this is the first Balor Fomorian attack but it won’t be the last. When the others come we must be ready.\n\n\nThe Lotus\n\n\n\nFomorian Vessels will intermittently appear in the Solar System as event nodes. These event nodes will be locked until you have the Fomorian Disruptor in your Consumable Inventory.\n\nYou will receive a Blueprint from the Lotus for the Fomorian Disruptor. It will require Nano Spores, Cryotic, and Omega Isotopes to craft.\n\nBuild your Disruptor in the Foundry and equip it in your Gear Menu to start the Fomorian Sabotage Mission.\n\nOnce in the Mission, fly to the Fomorian. Once you’re close enough to the Fomorian you must disable the exterior Shield Cores so you can enter the ship.\n\nThe Fomorian’s internal Shield Generators are protected by a magnetic field. Use your Fomorian Disruptor from the Gear menu to disrupt the magnetic field, and temporarily expose the Shield Generators, allowing you to destroy them.\n\nWith the Shield Generators destroyed you can now deal damage to the ship’s Main Reactor Power Cores.\n\nAfter damaging the cores, escape to safety outside the Fomorian.\n\n\n\nCompleting a successful Sabotage run will earn you event points, and reduce the global health of the Fomorian.\n\nYour Fomorian Disruptor will be consumed after completing the Fomorian Sabotage mission.\n\nThis Operation is on now until Monday, January 5 at 12 PM EST.\n\n\n\nCompleting the Fomorian Sabotage mode successfully will earn you one Battle Point.\n\nYou can earn a maximum of one Battle Point per Fomorian. Repeating the same Fomorian will not generate additional Battle Points. These points will count towards individual rewards.\n\nFomorian missions with a higher level of difficulty will provide extra points.\nLeaderboards are available for players that want to compete for the best score during Fomorian Sabotage Missions. Your individual score is determined by the amount of damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core during a single run. The highest scores can only be achieved by squads with coordinated deployment of Fomorian Disruptors, and efficient attacks on the Power Cores.\n\n\nClan Scoring considers the following:\n\nYour score will be based on the most damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core in a given mission. Clan score is sum of personal best but divided by max clan size for that tier (ie: 10 for Ghost Clan, 1000 for Moon).\n\n\n\n3 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Skin Pack (Badge + Rahk Fluctus Skin)\n10 BATTLE POINTS: Eyes of Blight Mod Pack (Magma Chamber + Searing Steel)\n15 BATTLE POINTS: Imperator Vandal\n\nClan Scoring: The Top three Clans in each tier will be awarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze Statues.\nTake down the Fomorian Ships, Tenno!\n\n\n\nPlayers can check out the Leaderboards for Operation Eyes of Blight here: http://content.warframe.com/dynamic/eyesOfBlight.php\n\nLeaderboards are updated every 15 minutes for Clans, and every 5 minutes for players.  Good luck, and may the best Tenno win!\n\nOmega Isotopes: Produced by a Fomorian’s power core, these particles only appear on planets where a Fomorian is present.  Omega Isotopes can only be obtained in non-Archwing missions where a Fomorian vessel is present.\n\n\n\nFixed Soma Prime and Vasto Prime not being visible in the Codex.\nFixed duplicate Stance Mods appearing in Codex as per: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/369502-duplicated-entries-on-the-mod-codex-shield-disruption-and-cleaving-whirlwind/\nFixed the Breach Loader Mod showing an incorrect description in the Arsenal.\nFixed audio issue when interrupting the Supra mid-reload.\nFixed non-Archwing Pistol and Shotgun Mods appearing in Archwing Missions.\nFixed the word ‘SCANNING’ appearing in the Codex for non-localized descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The following Mod Augments are now available through the Syndicate Offerings:\n\n\n\n\nThe Corpus have begun salvaging their crashed ships on Europa for valuable goods, loading up heavy all-terrain vehicles with cargo for shipment off planet.  Their most treasured shipment of recovered goods has just been readied for extraction, and it’s your job to make sure those secrets go to Tenno hands.\n\nLocate the Corpus shipment, then guide it safely to extraction through the frozen remains of a Corpus ship’s crash site.\nThe Corpus shipment’s vehicle has been re-routed to draw power from Warframe Shields.  Defending the shipment (and one another) from weapon’s fire is the key to victory.\n\n\nFixed visual overlap on some objects within the Dojo.\nFixed players being able to see into the Void when in the Dojo’s Tenno Research Lab.\nFixed the Marketplace not properly updated item quantity when player enters a new amount they wish to purchase.\nFixed several locked doors in the Orokin Derelicts showing up in green.\nFixed player Liset decorations floating in midair in the docking station of the Relay Station.\nFixed players waiting longer than necessary to enter a Relay when in a party.\nFixed players not being able to see any visual effects when picking up an oxygen tank in Survival.\nFixed players being unable to enter a Dojo through the Clan menu when in a Relay.\nFixed enemies only appearing in small groups of 2-3 when playing on Ice Planet Defense.\nFixed enemies targeted by Trinity’s Energy Vampire becoming stuck in an animation loop.\nFixed issue that would occur from leaving a squad at the exact moment the host disbanded the squad.\nFixed certain Syndicate Mods not functioning correctly, or not displaying new buffed modifiers as per: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/361795-broken-syndicate-mods-thread/\nFixed load time delays during Archwing Mission deployment cinematics.\nFixed all visual issues related to Warframe Reddit thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/2oxq2n/im_sorry_once_again_ude_killerkarpfen_i_have/\nFixed Mesa’s Shooting Gallery buffing enemy players in Dark Sector PvP.\nFixed players becoming stuck in Mesa’s Peacemaker after repeated use of the Ability.\nFixed Ash’s Bladestorm targeting enemies immune to Abilities after the initial target is killed.\nFixed some Archwing weapons dealing no damage to Sabotage Mission objective.\nFixed Liset Foundry flashing an update for players staying on the Liset during a content Update.\nFixed the Tenno Lab not appearing on the minimap of the Clan Dojo.\nFixed the Patient Zero blueprint not appearing in Marketplace.\n",

We now know that more information exists and we must look for it in Orokin Derelicts locked in the Void.\nOur mission is urgent. The Grineer have also learned about the Archwing Technology and they are determined to destroy all traces of it before we find it. To do this, Vay Hek is using Void Keys and Torsion Beam Generators to force open Orokin portals.\nWe must destroy his access to these portals. Our ability to recover Archwing fragments depends on it.\nCareful, Tenno. Vay Hek is using unstable keys. Cumulative exposure to the keys will have detrimental effects on your health, shields and Warframe abilities. Proceed accordingly.\nThe Lotus\n\n\nStart the event node on Earth.\n\nPlay through the mission, defeat the Grineer bosses and destroy the Void Portal Key.\n\nIf you want to take the risk, search out resource caches to find high-value items.\n\nExposure to the Void Portal will begin to affect you. Exposure weakens your Warframe. The effects are cumulative – the more missions you run, the weaker you become.\n\nEach mission run you will earn 1 Exposure point.\n\nMore Exposure points earned = higher Rewards.\n\nEarn 5 Exposure points on a node to unlock a new node.\n\nNodes to unlock (in order):  Phobos, Ceres, Challenge Node located back on Phobos.\n\nThe Challenge Node has no Exposure point cap. Keep earning Exposure points for as long as you are capable --\nknow that your Warfame will be in an extremely weakened state the further you progress.\n\n\nThis Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 24 at 12 PM EDT.\nSuccessfully complete the Mission and you'll be rewarded with:\n5 Exposure points: Event Badge and Phobos node unlocked\n10 Exposure points: Set of 4 Mods – Buzz Kill, Fanged Fusillade, Sweeping Serration and Maim\n15 Exposure points: Sheev Dagger: Built for close combat, the Sheev's plasma blade slices through flesh and armor with equal ease.\nThe top 3 Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies.\nClan Leaderboards: A Clan’s score is the sum of its members’ scores.\nPlease be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.\n\nInterested in seeing the leaderboards online?

As part of Operation: Gate Crash, these new hybrid maps will combine the Void with various locations throughout the Solar System.\nNew Dojo Teleporter Decorations! Starting today, you can now place teleport beacons in your Dojo! These are decorations that can be named & dropped in the Dojo by those with necessary permissions. When you engage one you will get a list of all other beacons in the Dojo and you can teleport between them!\nAdded improvements to Vor’s Prize and the Tutorial for simplification and polish purposes including:\nProgress bar of tutorial stage\nRemoved transmissions for simplification\nReduced weapon choices from 3 per group to 2 per group.\nRelit tutorial and swapped skybox and effects for a more polished appearance.\nReduced Warframe’s power set to just First ability for the tutorial.\n\nChanges:\nDisabled Local Reflections and High Dynamic Range on certain Direct X9 enabled video cards which do not properly support these features.\nThe \"Get to Extraction\" message will now play when Survival Alert timers hit 0. Also ensured that the \"Operation has succeeded\" transmission plays before  the \"Extraction is now ready\" message.\nPvP Change: Ash’s Bladestorm reduced to 0.25 damage multiplier from 0.5.\nFurther improved the aiming of Mirage's Prism projectile.\nEnergy Vampire will no longer provide energy to Banshees performing Sound Quake so as to prevent infinite energy usage.\nImproved the damage number font to ensure sharper looking damage numbers when scaled up.\nImproved the loading performance of the Kubrow customization menus.\nImproved the performance of Mirage's Prism and Nova's Wormhole ability.\nImproved procedural level generation to fix several issues with AI behaviour that was frequently reported in Void Survival missions.  These improvements and fixes will resolve issues where you may see door frames poking through adjacent tiles, superfluous connectors going nowhere, and other level issues caused by procedural generation.\nAdditional improvements to prevent slow Clients from holding an entire squad on loading screen.\nImproved visibility for Clan/Alliance invites by treating all of these invites as high-priority, which will be seen at login.  \nDisabled ally blue glow while in the Dojo with other Tenno.\nFixes:\nFixed an issue with the background being displayed incorrectly on the Extractor selection screen.\nFixed an issue with Nekros' Soul Punch not working correctly in PvP matches.\nFixed an issue with Stalker related blueprints not appearing at the end of match screen correctly.\nFixed a crash related to quickly joining the same Dojo twice.\nFixed numerous crashes and squad formation issues.\nFixed an issue with the Cancel button on the Solar Map not working correctly.\nFixed an issue with weapon attachments obstructing text in the Pause menu and in the body of Inbox messages.\nFixed an issue with profane words being able to be used as Clan names.\nFixed an issue with the Savior of Earth achievement not unlocking properly after beating Vay Hek.\nFixed an issue with the Drone Explosion sound effect not playing properly from the area where the Drone was destroyed.\nFixed Mirage's Prism not being properly castable by AI.\nFixed a number of map holes in the Shipyards Sabotage tileset.\nFixed an issue with text in the Arsenal overlapping when equipping a new weapon to an empty slot.\nFixed an issue with players being blocked from unlocking Solar Map nodes by Dark Sector nodes which do not have a Solar Rail currently deployed on them.\nFixed an issue with players being able to claim Defense mission rewards without actually extracting.\nFixed issues with loadouts hanging briefly as helmets, skins, and other customizations are loaded.\nFixed issue where players were unable to use Void Keys as recipe ingredients if you only had one type of a given key.\nFixed an issue where enemies caught in Vauban’s Vortex will oscillate and vibrate in an unappealing way.\nFixed issue where Melee weapons (like the Galatine with an attachment) and attachments would obstruct the UI.\nFixed issue with Trinity’s Blessing fully restores the health of the Fomorian power core in Hijack missions.\nFixed issue where Ash could Bladestorm targets at panels in Interception missions, rendering them ignored by future enemy AI.\nFixed an issue in the Market regarding proper classification of Kubrow starter kits and color bundles.\n",

  "changes": "Additions:\n\nAdded Rank display to item browsing, meaning you can now see what rank your gear is in the inventory. As an example, in the scenario of building an Aklex and you have three, one which is Rank 30, you can now see the item's rank in this new display!\nUnlisted 14.6.0 change: There is now a Dojo chat tab when in the Dojo!\n\n\nTrinity's Blessing is now recastable while passive damage reduction is active. This means you no longer need to wait for your Duration timers to expire before being able to recast Blessing.\n\nFirstly, an explanation in intent and next steps:\nDev observed and experienced the uninhibited blinding effect in up to a 60 M Range with several environments coming between Excalibur and targets. This prompted review.\nSecondly, the 14.6.0 changes have all been reverted as they were experimental and not intended to function in the way they did for this brief 12 hour window.\nThirdly, what you can expect down the road is Radial Blind functioning in a way that considers Line-of-sight. The 14.6.0 unintended version suffered from a lot of problems with this approach, and coming will be radically improved line-of-sight checks for Radial Blind. Targets behind cover that can still see Excalibur are blinded. Other bodies won’t inhibit their blindness, but walls will.\n\n\nFirst, a quick brief in the history of changes this Mod has undergone:\nThis Mod was originally fixed to not give a player energy for damage that was never dealt to player. When we added the damage predeath state in Conclaves, etc, the original fix was unintentionally reverted.\nThe 14.6.0 fix resolves issues where Rage + Quick Thinking gave effective permanent invulnerability because energy was being added to pool that was never dealt to player. With this change in mind, the combination of Rage and Quick Thinking may seem less efficient as before due to no longer giving effective invulnerability. The scope of this change is being monitored to ensure the usefulness of these Mods as a combination.\n\n\nChanged loading screen/matchmaking logic to move on if after 10 seconds Client is unable to properly join/connect. Elaboration: Fixes entire squad being stuck on loading screen while waiting for low end PC to load.\nChanged the attack ferocity of Corpus Mine Osprey: before no maximum existed on number of deployed mines, and now there is a maximum of 6.\nRemoved Kubrow roaming in Liset until further notice.\nTweaked performance of Local Reflections code on Dx10 and Dx11 to address potential FPS loss.\nPvP Bladestorm balancing:-Reduced maximum number of attacks to [2, 3, 4, 5] to address issues with players getting stuck in Bladestorm-ed state for up to 15+ hits.-Increased the PvP damage multiplier from 0.1 per hit to 0.5 per hit in an effort to keep damage output in line with previous values.\n",
  "fixes": "\nFixed issue with Captain Vor being unbeatable on Mercury.\nFixed an issue with Nova’s Molecular Prime explosions caused by self-destructing enemies damaging teammates and defense objectives.\nFixed issues with users connecting behind proxies being unable to update the game.\nFixed an issue where Lotus would constantly talk to you at the end of Survival Alerts.\nFixed a game freeze that would occur when attempting to fuse or change mods.\nFixed game freeze when focusing on the categories menu after opening the item browsing screen in Foundry.\nFixed interception console ‘hitswitch’ pushing AI through the terrain on Grineer maps.\nFixed navigation issues that prevented faithful Kubrow from joining in the fight against Lephantis.\nFixed issues with Void missions not pausing when playing Solo and hitting ESC.\nFixed several crashes.\n",

  "changes": "Update 14.5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERATION CRYOTIC FRONT\n\nDig for valuable Artifacts!\n\n\n\nA message from a Mystery Associate:\n\n\n\nTenno,\n\n\n\nI do hope you will forgive my concealed identity but dealing in these unsavoury circles demands unusual discretion.\n\nI’m such a big fan of the Tenno, you’ve accomplished so much and with such rudimentary equipment. That’s why I’m concerned about the coming Balor Fomorians. I think we both know your Warframes are simply not sophisticated enough to stop them.\n\nBut I can help you... for a price.\n\nYou see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I’ve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.\n\nTo sweeten the deal I am even willing award bonuses to those of you who exhibit outstanding performance.\n\nI must say, some of you display the inklings of good taste, if our partnership is a success perhaps we will get to know each other better.\n\nRegards,\n\nYour New Associate\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay the new Excavation missions!\n\n\nThe Location of a ‘Scanning Device’ will appear on your minimap for you to locate.\n\n\nCollect Power Cells dropped by enemies, and bring them to the Scanner to activate it and keep it powered. You can track your Scanner’s power in the map on your HUD. If it reaches 0%, the process will stall until power is restored.\n\n\nDefend the Scanner as it searches for a dig site. Once the Scanner has found a site, it will appear on your map. Proceed to that location to find an Excavator that is digging for artifacts.\n\n\nTake caution!  Enemy waves will attempt to destroy the Excavator, and you must defend it. The Excavator will also continue to lose power. As with the Scanner, you must collect Power Cells to keep it activated.\n\n\nOnce the Excavator has uncovered the artifact, you may choose to Extract from the operation or wait for another Scanner and repeat the process.\n\n\nThere are three available Tilesets for this Operation.\n\n\nWhat is CRYOTIC (New Resource)?\n\nUsually found in extreme sub-zero environments, Cryotic instantly freezes anything it comes in contact with.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Excavator is destroyed before it recovers an item, the mission is a failure.\n\n\nThe Operation is on now until Wednesday, September 3 at 12 PM EDT.\n\n\nOperation Cryotic Front is the first introduction of a new mission type that will replace all Survival missions that take place on a terrestrial tileset.\n\n\nThis Operation introduces Cryotic, a new resource that will only be available in the Excavation game mode.\n\n\nAt each of the point levels below and you’ll unlock a new Tileset in the Operation. It’s your choice – continue to dig on Earth or take your efforts to these new areas. Note that each new Tileset will hold more difficult enemies but will provide the opportunity to earn points faster.\n\n\n\n\nWith each successful dig, you will receive an amount of Cryotic based on your performance (100 max.) The more Cryotic you earn, the better the Reward – so dig on!\n\nMore than 500 pts = Event Badge\n\nMore than 1000 pts = Ice Mod Set (4 dual-stat mods)\n\nMore than 3000 pts = Latron Wraith and the Polar Glaxion skin\n\n\n\nNote: The basis for the rewards is your best score in one single run.\n\n\n\n\nThe top three Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze Trophies. For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of active personal bests.\n\nPlease be aware that people joining clans after the event has started will not contribute to their new clans score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Added new Colour Customization options available through 2 new packs! These packs are brand new colours that can be applied to your current Kubrow patterns!\n\n• Added a base palette pack that includes 5 colors you can play with for 100K credits!\n\n• Kubrows are now in free-roam mode on the Liset!\n\n• Price of DNA Stabilizers reduced from 100k to 75k credits.\n\n• Added a “Consign to the Lotus” button for unwanted Kubrows.  Fear not, the Lotus shall take care of them!\n\n• Additional animations for Kubrow Cubs!\n\n• Added Kubrow filters for Mods.\n\n\n\n\n\nArmor:\n\n• Oberon’s base Armor increased to 150.\n\n\n\nSmite:\n\n• Projectiles that are spawned after impact seek-to-target, not just spawned in direction.\n\n• Speed up projectiles by 50%.\n\n• Forced Radiation proc on the initial target.\n\n• Forced Knock-down on initial target instead of stumble.\n\n• Forced Puncture proc on all enemies hit.\n\nHallowed Ground:\n\n• Allies within Hallowed Ground can not be proc’ed.\n\n• Hallowed Ground will remove all existing procs from Allies.\n\n• Armour boosted by 5/10/15/20% per rank for all Allies on Hallowed Ground, with stacking being explored on multiple casts.\n\nRenewal:\n\n• Switch to toggle ability with smaller base cost and energy per second active drain. All Renewal benefits occur when projectile reaches target ally.\n\n• Boost Heal amount 200/250/300/400 per rank.\n\n• When target is fully healed, remove any active proc effects.\n\n• Allies affected by Renewal have slowed bleedout by 20/25/35/45% per rank. This is affected by duration mods.\n\nReckoning:\n\n• Forced Radiation Proc added to damage on targets.\n\n• Small radial blind added to slam impact, but only for enemies that survive the damage of the cast. This radial blind will be applied to enemies that move into range after it’s been cast and are blinded by the impact of those being slammed by Reckoning!\n\n\n\n\n• Made Vauban's Vortex scale with power range and duration mods.\n\n\n\n\n• Nyx’s Absorb has had it’s passive energy drain significantly reduced from 10 energy per second to 4 energy per second, and instead now has an energy drain based on incoming damage. This drain is 8 energy per 1000 damage. These drainage values are affected with the use of mods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• In an effort to compensate for more useful attribution of XP when triggering a chain reaction with Molecular Prime, the main XP is attributed to whoever started the chain reaction. Before, Nova would take the bulk of the attribution. Now,  the \"weapon and instigator\" carry through the whole explosion chain ( if Player A casts Molecular Prime and Player B blows up the room, Player B gets the kills and XP). Similarly, if Player A casts Molecular Prime to Crowd-Control and then use their slowed state to get a nice bow-shot, Player B get weapon XP.\n\n• Fixed some of the cases where two Nova's casting Molecular Prime would have unexpected results (explosion range and strength were always determined by the Nova who cast most recently).\n\n\n\n\n• Added HUD counter for Rhino Stomp to show how much longer you have left on your CC (and how long to wait until re-stomp).\n\n\n\n\n• Banshee's Sonar, and the Enemy Radar/Sense mods ignore security cameras and turrets.\n\n• Banshee’s Sonar now uses Energy Colour.\n\n\n\n\n• Saryn’s Miasma can now be cast mid-air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Changed FX of Laser Doors when affected by Mirage’s abilities to better indicate you’re safe to run through.\n\n• Update several Foley sounds: more updates to Tenno step, fixed rhythm and step events for wall running.\n\n• Updated Host Election code to work with new squad system (had been disabled since Update 14).\n\n• Added more details to error messages for invitation and join problems (we are hoping that more information will help us isolate any remaining problems with the invitation system).\n\n\n\n",
  "fixes": "\n\n\n• Fixed the UI still showing stats for a “Charge Attack” when looking at Melee weapons.\n\n• Fixed friends and clan sessions panel showing invite-only or objective-reached sessions (aka unjoinable and merely teasing.)\n\n• Fixed all consumable restoration totems (Energy, Health, etc) not travelling with you on elevators when you ascend or descend.\n\n• Fixed Player’s game freezing for short periods when decorations complete while in the Dojo.\n\n• Fixed Dendra armor colour not updating until you leave the attachments part of the Arsenal.

Specific examples: void turrets, arc traps, Grineer laser sensors above doors, smashable grates & fans.\n\n• Fixed issue with Dex Furis muzzle flash not being customizable.\n\n• Fixed issues with consumables purchased through Arsenal not being automatically equipped.\n\n• Fixed player completing a Rank Up Test and their Mastery Level will not update right away on the Player's Profile Box at the top of the Pause Menu\n\n• Fixed an issue where you could rapidly hit the button to toggle the chat window while transitioning out of any diegetic screen in the Ship UI, and sometimes it would half-open the chat window and leave the screen darkened\n\n• Fixed issue if when the player is in the rail management screen, and they press the pause menu button, the pause menu will open behind the rail management screen. However once they do this they will be unable to close the pause menu as well be unable to exit the rail management screen.\n\n• Fixed issue where Crit damage and Crit chance are not increased by mods for Sentinel weapons.\n\n• Fixed issues with overlapping text in solar rail deployments.\n\n• Fixed an issue where the player could attempt to bring up the pause menu while viewing any part of the Codex, which led to an inconsistent UI experience. Now attempting to open the pause menu while in the Codex will function the same as if the player wishes to back out of the current screen.\n\n• Fixed issue where it would become possible to lose functionality in certain Dark Sector conflict scenarios.\n\n• Fixed issue where players could finish the tutorial without gaining any XP in gear causing account issues later on.\n\n• Fixed issues with long Kubrow names clipping outside stasis slots.\n\n• Fixed rank-up tests being rendered unbeatable if proper loadout isn`t active, no prompts inform user of necessary loadout.\n\n• Fixed issue where if a players rejoins a lobby after having previously run out of revives in that same lobby, they will not properly be put into spectator mode and will be have no functionality until the other players complete the mission.\n\n• Fixed an issue where the MatchMaking drop down list was still visible in the Clan screen when opened from within the Solar Map (causing duplicate button callouts and leaving no way to change the Clan member list's sort method.)\n\n• Fixed Infested Ancients and Grineer Scorpions from using their grapple pull ability on Saryn's Molt avatar and Loki's Decoy avatar as it would not behave well (would have them pause for a few moments, if Molt was used again it would script error and break the enemy). This also fixes a similar issue with Vay Hek’s beam-zap attack.\n\n• Fixed issues with Sentinel ‘Weapon Slot’ behavior in Arsenal when switching between Sentinels and Kubrows.\n\n• Fixed issues with blank “Trigger” types in the UI for Penta, Castanas and Deconstructor.\n\n• Fixed issues with navigating the UI with arrow keys equipping things unintentionally \narrow key navigation in Arsenal has been disabled.\n\n• Fixed issue where performing any melee action, then using a context action (Hack Console, Revive Ally), would result in an additional melee action after the context action was complete.\n",

We are using a stem approach so that players hear different parts of the music at all times!\n\nMirage’s Harlequin Helmet\nHydroid’s Ketos Helmet!\nZephyr’s Tengu Helmet!\nAdded friendly NPC wall running. Specters, Rescue targets and Kubrow can learn where to wall run from the players.\nAdded Eximus/Leader spawn scaling to Defense missions.\nAdded an extra boost to wall-run melee attacks if you channel melee.\nAdded CPU performance improvements.\nAlliance Emblems have been added for Warlords/Alliance Founder to upload at www.warframe.com\nAlliance Renames are here! Sick of being called the Tootsie Roll Slammers? Now you can change to the Jawbreakin’ Jostlers!\nAdded new Wall Run + Strike animations for Axe, Scythe, Staff, and Claw weapons.\nAdded the ability for Founding Warlords of a clan to demote other Warlords. Please note this is only possible for clans founded after we started flagging the detail of clan Founder, which occurred shortly after Update 13.\nAdded visual effect on friendly hacked Moas.\nAdded the ability to Slide Jump into a wall run. Before you would just slide and jump at the wall, but now, if aimed and the correct functions pressed, this will transition into a wall run.\nAdded support for additional aspect ratios.\nAdded in a graphics option to disable Anisotropic Filtering. This should help with increase performance by approximately 10% on Intel HD Graphics units.\nAdded an ‘accept all’ pending friend requests option as a context action under the accept friend menu.\nAdded a new Animation when you use a Revive in a session.\nAdded all 3 Diorama Winners from the Diorama Contest of days past!

The higher your combo chain, the more damage Hysteria will do!\nVolt's Electric Shield now has a countdown timer.

The death explosion causes stagger, and damage scales up with their level.\nInfested Leapers: Their leaping attack can be parried to nullify the stagger. Leap damage scales with their level.\nAll Ancients can pull targets (Pull can be blocked or dodged).\nAll Ancients \nbetter anticipation of knockdown attack. It can now be parried to nullify damage and the knockdown.\nToxic Ancients \nDo poison damage and gives all nearby enemies poison damage. Ancient and nearby enemies are resistant to poison and gas damage.\nHealing Ancients \nLinks with nearby allies, any damage they take heals the Ancient up to 150% health, and it scales up to reflect having health > 100%.

The health of his legs was changed to a % of his total health, which scales up with level, making it harder to knock him into his stun state. His stun timer was also decreased while the damage required to break him out of stun early was also increased and made as a % of his total health rather than a set value.\nMade several changes to the Derelict Survival mission to improve spawning.\nPolished the logic for connecting procedural levels.\nIncreased the number of connectors to increase play space.\nIncreased spawn room chance.\nRemoved tentacle traversal room (Giant open room which branches are navigated) from intermediate spawning, will only occur as dead end.\n\nRemoved the locked door to extraction, as it only limits the available spawn locations within the first 5 minutes.\nIncreased the number of small dead end rooms (caps) which can generate in place of red locked doors, providing more spawn locations for enemies.\nAdded some new small cap tiles for Asteroid, Settlement, Outpost and Galleon tilesets.\nRestructured the Derelict Survival procedural level so it has more small tiles between the main areas.  There are still three larger main areas which have life support capsule spawn points.  \nThe 'stacking' bug was fixed, capsules don't spawn instantly on activating a capsule if the level is full.\nThe first room's capsule spawns are no longer switched off after one use.  Since the first room is reused, each level may now have 2-3 more simultaneous capsules active before it reaches capacity.  Originally the level structure was a little different, disabling spawns was intended to keep players closer to extraction after moving on from the first room.\nAdded infested crawlers to survival enemy spec.\n\nOptimized game memory to improve stability for 32-bit systems and reduce load-times. This optimization includes up to ⅓ less data being loaded on boot.\nCompleting an Alert on a node you have locked no longer unlocks the node underneath.\nRemoved blood/dismembered Grineer from Excalibur's codex entry ...he didn't mean to hurt anyone.\nIncreased decoration capacity in the trophy room for adequate trophy placement.\nChanges to mod art: Decisive Judgement and Tranquil Cleave used the same image, now they don’t!\nChanged Ruk’s image in the “Enemies” section of the Codex.\nChanges to visual effect when Melee killing an enemy while Channeling.\nImproved performance on effects that use the the particle system.\nRevisited Nekros tinting.\nLoki Prime's decoy now holds a Lex Prime!\nMaterial updates to Corpus ship hull Cores.\nMade curved walls larger to better support wall runs in the Orokin Void.\nTweaked the Bow Idle animations on Loki, Mag, Valkyr, and Hydroid Warframes.\nImproved Melee Ground Attack position accuracy.\nTweaked the sound effects for all Warframes entering Smoke Screen.\nImproved the positioning of melee accessories on Boomerang weapons (Kestrel).\nImproved the cast sound effect for Loki's Radial Disarm ability.\nImproved the performance of multiple general environmental effects.\nLimited the max instances of Karak, Soma, and Gorgon fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Cestra fire sound effects.\nLimited the max instances of Dex Furis fire sound effects.\nTweaked the sound effect for Loki’s Decoy cast and spawn in sound effects.\nPlayer's can no longer be staggered when quick Meleeing with the Glaive.\nPolished some of Tyl Regor's animations.\nImproved the cast sound for Volt's Speed ability.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Corpus Crewmen and Moa.\nTweaked the weapon fire sound effects on the Dera and Hind.\nTweaked the sounds of the Grineer rifle melee attack sound effects.\nAdjusted the Helmet position of Corrupted Crewmen.\nImproved the performance of the Interception territory area indicator.\nImproved the visuals on Mag's Pull ability.\nLoki's Decoy ability deploy sound effect is now positional and will not be heard by players past a certain distance.\nIncreased the volume of Vauban's power cast sound effects.\nReduced the pitch variance in Axe sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Forest Defense tileset decorations.\nImproved performance on the Torid and Drakgoon Effects.\nReduced the amount of resonance on Axe hit sound effects.\nLimited the instances of Corpus Laser Weapon fire sound effects.\nImproved the performance of a number of Gas City tilesets.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in the Grineer Galleon tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nRemoved blood decals from bleeding procs as this caused performance issues on certain terrain sets.\nTweaked the duration and fade on multiple Hydroid ability sound effects.\nOptimized a number of lighting assets in Corpus Ship tilesets in an effort to increase performance.\nImproved the weapon trail visuals on Whip type weapons.\nOptimized the performance of particle effects.\nTweaked the slide animations when holding Great Sword weapons.\nUpdated multiple Warframe dioramas with proper colors.\nImproved the Grineer Hit reactions to Radial Disarm.\nImproved the performance of Ash's Smoke Screen on lower end PC's.\n\n",

Using these newly engineered \"Hive\" organisms, the Infestation is able to corrupt a new ship or colony almost instantly. There are also disturbing reports coming in that the virus has evolved. It is now capable of absorbing and corrupting non-organic beings. Not even the robotic soldiers of the Corpus are safe now. The only way to stop the spread is to destroy these hives.\nWe have just received word of a massive outbreak near Eris. An entire fleet of Corpus ships has been exposed to this new bioplague. Alad V is almost certainly responsible. If Alad V's hives are allowed to gain a strategic foothold here, the Infested will become unstoppable. They will overrun the system in a matter of days. If we don’t put an end to this now, the Corpus, the Grineer, the Tenno...we could all fall in the wake of this horrible scourge.\n-The Lotus\n\n\nOperation: Breeding Grounds will include point structure that allows for rewards based on points earned in ONE SINGLE mission! This will be denoted in the UI in the \"Best\" field under the Operations tab to help you keep track of your current best score.\n6 points: Breeding Grounds badge!\n17 points: Dual Stat Fire Mods!\n48 points: Prova Vandal!\nThe top 3 Clans per Clan Tier will receive Gold, Silver, and Bronze “Breeding Grounds” Trophies! For Clan Leaderboards, a Clan’s score is the sum of the Best Point run for all members.\n\n\nDifficulty of the mission is increased in the following way:\n\nYou will notice a \"Total\" value in the UI under the Operations tab. The higher this number, the stronger the stink and more difficult the missions! All Tenno will begin playing ‘Difficulty 1’ missions with ‘Difficulty 1’ hives! But, this difficulty won’t stay at ‘1’ forever. The Infested can smell the carnage of your missions and will become more and more difficult and aggressive the more Breeding Ground missions you complete. It will take several runs for the stink of the Infested to stick to you. By completing more missions, you will encounter more difficult hives and more difficult enemies! These difficulty increases will allow you to yield higher points in a single run, with endless potential if you want to compete in clan leaderboards!\nNote: grouping together with other Tenno will have an affect on difficulty depending on the level of combined stench!\nEnjoy! We plan on making Hive Sabotage a permanent addition to the game down the road, so let us know what you think!\n\nFixed a number of crashes.\nFixed Conclave bug where Conclave Score check did not occur if you joined a session from your friends list or via invite.

  "changes": "\nWe have made changes to the way Criticals work on weapons that have been modded to have a crit chance greater than 100%. You may recall the existence of ‘red crits’ from many updates ago, which occurred with no clear formula other than “Synapse!”. Here is some clarity into the new system:\n\nThe brief:\n\nA weapon with a critical chance greater than 100% will receive 2 calculations:\n\n1) a guaranteed critical damage value \nthis normally appears as a yellow value.\n\nThis means:\nIf your rate is 125% you get one guaranteed crit and a 25% chance of a red crit.\n\nIf this Second Crit occurs, you will see a deadly Red crit value!\n\n\nAsh\nBlade Storm has received a rework! Now when the ability is used Ash will conjure up to two separate clones which will go on the attack in addtion to the player! This will allow the player clear out large groups of enemies even quicker!\nChanges:\nMiter base damage has been increased along with the flight speed and proc chance of charged shots\nIncreased Fatal Attraction's range and damage at Rank 4 and 5.\nThe Fatal Attraction precept will now wait until enemies are within range before the pull ability is initialized.\nTweaked the positioning on the Leg Armor accessories for a number of Warframes.\nAdded in an additional range based visual effect on Molecular Prime that should help with distinguishing the distance of targets affected by the ability.\nTweaked the Excalibur Prime Channeling visual effects.\nSpecters will now re-generate Energy over time now so as to allow them to continue to use Powers over long amounts of time.\nPlayer movement is now prohibited at the start of Conclave rounds.\nTweaked the sound effects for the Skana Prime.\nReduced the amount of damage dealt to attacking players when using Reflection in PvP matches.\nTweaked the visuals on Valkyr's Immortal Skin.\nTweaked the sound effects on the Moa Laser Disc gun explosion and Drone Explosion.\nReduced required scans for Grineer Rollers.\nImproved the animations for the Greatsword and Axe animation sets.\nThe first round of Interception missions will now be easier for Solo players with enemies spawning throughout the mission. The difficulty will remain the same when playing with 2-4 players.\nAdjusted the positioning of Chest Armor on Ember, Banshee, Valkyr, Zephyr, Vauban, Saryn, and Nyx.\n\nFixes:\nFixed issues with many Sentinel precepts having their priority subverted by other slotted precepts. Example, if you ever noticed your Djinn would never seem to cast Fatal Attraction, it is likely because it was slotted in the 2nd/3rd/4th Precept Slot and was not properly prioritized.\nFixed a number of crashes.\nFixed a number of localization issues.\nFixed an issue with players being unable to exit Conclaves properly.\nFixed an issue with the Invite Button not appearing correctly when playing Key lobby missions.\nFixed an issue with the Codex not properly listing the correct amount of Mods present in the player’s inventory.\nFixed an instance of Molecular Prime energy color not appearing correctly on client.\nFixed an issue with Molecular Prime not working correctly in PvP matches.\nFixed an issue with enemies attempting to pursue players after a successful extraction.\nFixed an issue with incorrect Lotus Voice Overs playing during Dark Sector Conflicts.\nFixed an issue with unequipped Sentinels still adding points towards Conclave ratings.\nFixed an issue with incorrect credit values being shown when depositing very large amounts of credits into the Clan Vault.\nFixed an issue with AI being unable to navigate up small ledges in the Shipyards tileset.\nFixed an issue with Shock Camo pack skins not properly utilizing custom Energy colors.\nFixed an issue with the Hikou Holster not properly utilizing custom Energy colors.\nFixed an issue with AI getting stuck behind certain crates and boxes on the Forest Defense Tileset.\nFixed an exploit which could cause players to gain inordinate amount of credits when selling items.\nFixed Seismic Palm and Fracturing Wind being erroneously labeled as \"Sparring\" which led to confusion on which weapons could use them. They are now labeled as “Fist” Stances.\nFixed a missing description for the Arcane Pulse Helmet.\nFixed an issue with Enemies remaining in their spawn area in Void Defense missions.\nFixed an erroneous description in Trinity's Energy Vampire ability.\nFixed issue with Ash being unable to use finishers on enemies that had been previously targeted by Bladestorm.\nFixed issue with Shock Camo skin not working on Snipetron Vandal.\n\n",

  "fixes": "Hotfix 13.2.3\n\nNews:\nHelmets with stat modifications have now been removed from the Market/Alert Cycle. Previously crafted or purchased Helmets with stats have been grandfathered in and will not be affected by this change. Additional Stat-to-Stateless Helmet recipes have been added to the Market for individuals wishing to change their current stat modifying helmets to purely cosmetic versions. To coincide with this change, the ability to trade Helmets has been added into the game as well. While the possible options to execute on this change were many, we do not feel comfortable removing the stats outright from gear players have spent hours and hours waiting for via alerts or spent Platinum on. The agency is in the players hand to remove the stats, and we will monitor to decide if further steps need to be taken.\nAdditions:\nAdded in a number of Loading Spinners to indicating when certain screens are loading in new data.\nAdded in a new Battle Pay Reserve section to the Dark Sector Menu. This will display a credit amount of how much Battle Pay is left for the selected Node.\nChanges:\nLowered resource costs for Specters and Specter Armies.\nDark Sector conflict missions have been replaced with Mobile Defense missions.\nChanged the End of Mission Results Screen term \"Head Shots\" to \"Headshot Kills\" for additional clarity.\nImproved the visual effects on multiple Warframe abilities.\nClan Message of the Day length has been restored to the original 256 character limit.\nOptimized energy color visuals to ensure that they match the visual effects for all items they are linked to.\nFixes:\nFixed an issue with the Deploy Rail button being highlighted on nodes protected by a Honor Armistice.\nFixed an issue with Dark Sector selection screens not updating properly after  Solar Rail has been deployed.\nFixed a number of localization issues.\nFixed a collision issue on elevators in the Orokin tileset.\nFixed an incorrectly placed blocking volume found in the Gas City tileset.\nFixed a number of crashes.\nFixed an issue with your Clan Name not being properly centered in the Dark Sector panel.\nFixed an issue with unintended fade outs happening during Outro Cinematics.\nFixed a graphical issue seen on the Inbox screen.\nFixed an issue with AI attempting to navigate through open spaces left by moving elevators on the Grineer tileset.\nFixed a visual issue related to the Nekros' Summons from Shadows of the Dead.\nFixed an issue with items being missing from the Ictus Sentinel Pack.\nFixed an issue where enemies killed right after being affected by Rhino’s Stomp ability would remain permanently floating in the air.\nFixed an issue with Mods temporarily disappearing and the scroll bar resetting after fusing a stack of Mods.\nFixed further issues with work in progress items appearing in the Codex.\nFixed an issue with Tornado visual effects appearing black under certain conditions.\nFixed another instance of Enemies getting stuck in upper tunnel section of the Forest tileset\nFixed a number of map holes including an issue with players being able to get out of the game play area on the Orokin Void tileset\n\n",

  "changes": "-  Increased stagger threshold and made stagger only occur on big hits instead of on accumulated damage; this should prevent situations where Quick Thinking would save you only to let you get knocked down and killed again.\n\nChanged enemy scaling for Endless Defense missions at high levels (now wave 100 enemies should be  around level 200 instead of 8000).\n\nRemoved the Candy Cane Scythe from the store.\n\nImproved Faction invasion momentum by periodically increasing score for leading faction by a small amount (since numerous stalemates have emerged which interfered with the flow of the system).\n\nImplemented Shadow Quality option for DirectX 11; also made it apply in places it did not previously. Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).\n\nMade all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).\n\nChanged Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.\n\nLoki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.\n\nChanged logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).\nThe frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.\nNow continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”\n\n",

Increased the damage amount and damage over time.\nFire Skin: Fire skin is now an offensive power rather than a defensive power. Reduced damage resistance and increased the damage output. Warframe strength mods now modify the damage amount.\nFire Blast: Fixed scaling problem, mesh scaled but the damage wall never did. Range mods no longer affect Fire blast, Duration and strength mods do.\nMag: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/102829-mag-98-feedback-thread/\nPull: Change damage type to use ragdolls for the pulling instead of sliding.

Instead target radiates a set amount of energy every couple of seconds. Also does damage to the target (Damage scales with strength mod).\nLink: No longer damage immunity--changed to damage reduction, now links to several targets at once amplifying the incoming damage. Increased radius search for link targets.\nBlessing: Anim speed changes and timing. No longer wait until end of casting animation to get power effects.\nVauban: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/102832-vauban-98-feedback-thread/\nBastille:  Ability now has a set number of targets. 6-8-10-12\nVortex:  No longer affects other players.\nNyx: https://forums.warframe.com/index.php?/topic/102833-nyx-98-feedback-thread/\nPsychic Daggers: Projectiles now seek and fly faster, more in line with other Warframes.\nAbsorb: Ability now has higher base damage and should attract more attention.\nGeneral:\nEnergy color tinting for Vauban’s Tesla and Vortex abilities.\nEnergy color tinting for Nova Antimatter Drop ability.\nTorid now uses energy color.\nParis Prime texture improvements.\nNew death animation for Mag’s Crush ability.\nVolt’s Speed ability trail FX now last the duration of the power.\nAdded some new ambient sounds to Grineer Settlement levels.\nUpdated sounds for Mag’s abilities.\nUpdated sound for Trinity’s Well of Life ability.\nVauban’s Tesla ability now has reduced FX on projectiles attached to players.\nPvP Dueling – Trinity can now effectively target opponents with all abilities.\nPvP Dueling – Vauban’s Bounce ability now does damage.\nPvP Dueling – Added cooldown to Excalibur Radial Blind ability to avoid exploits.\nHealing Ancient heal radius reduced to 30m range (was infinite).\nTool tips now appear for Alt Helmets.\nMisc. items section of inventory no longer adds empty slots (unnecessary)\nSound ducking from mix effects is now attenuated by distance as well as the volume ratio (user set volume levels, for example)\nAdded embedded damage radius to projectiles.\nChanged damage done by embedded projectiles to be affected by armor.\nAnimation and Audio tweaks to some Warframe Agile and Noble animations.\n2:43 PM addition:\nIndicated items in the Gear area of the Market are being retired in a later update \nLast Chance!\n2:53 PM addition:\n\nYou may notice that mods you have equipped in a weapon are in your options for customization in other weapons. You no longer need to remove the mod from weapon X to equip in weapon Y, it will appear in the UI for you now.\nAddition: If you find yourself saying \"Now I wasted mods fusing up duplicate X because I can equip the same mod twice on Sentinel/etc.\" This will likely not be possible in the future so don't sell your duplicates!\n\n",

  "fixes": "7.7.1 Hot-Fix + \"About Last Night...\":\nSome of you may have noticed our change lists from yesterday were incomplete (/sarcasm).\nWhile we are apt to make controversial changes in Warframe until the end of time, it is our intention to be upfront about it*. How else would I maintain this supple flame-singed hue? We are formalizing how the changelists are compiled in the future. We will never be perfect, but we can do better.\nHere is what 7.7.1 has as well as important notes absent from the prior update:\n-Chat server upgraded to allow moderation, unified authentication and blunt the hacking attempts.\n-Increased the curve of AI damage/shields for higher level enemies... but then:\n-After more testing, toned down those same curves for high level enemies (split the difference).\n-Reduced simultaneous enemy counts when playing Solo.\n-Restored missing sounds (Hek).\n-Rollback frame-rate dependency fixes for automatic weapons (too much fallout, but this is fixed properly soon).\n-Added more blueprints to Alerts (Alt helmets, Weapon skins).\n-Increase health, shields and regeneration on Cryo-casket in Defense Mode.\n-Rare Mods are now... rare. Faction drop tables were boosting probabilities past Common in some cases.\n-Fix gear becoming unequipped after relogin/return from mission.\n-Fix default Exalibur appearing on title screen.\n-Removed work-in-progress loadout preset option (incomplete).\n*-excluding things we want to surprise you with.\nAbout turn-around time: We do not have moderation and customer support 24/7. I think it is heading that way, but it's not there yet. Try to temper \"Wtf no dev response!\" with that in mind.\nAbout chat: Chat moderation is ad-hoc, but if you're being a jerk we will warn you, kick you, ban you, then suspend your account. Remember the Tenno ways. Humor and Honor are not mutually exclusive.\nAbout difficulty: We are planning more difficulty choice to sidestep the Goldilocks problem here. As much as you think the game is too easy or too hard there is always someone who feels the opposite. Internally we felt the early-game was too hard, the end-game a bit too easy. The longer-term fix is to give players choice since one size does not fit all.\nNext: Bug fixes of course! This goes in tandem with new hotness. In the next few weeks expect tileset expansion, new weapons and more crazy Mods. Update 8 (dramatic cue: \"Rise of the Warlords\") has also begun which will be a leap forward for Warframe and breathe a sense of life and purpose into Warframe Clans.\n(Also note the absurd number scheme, don't take 7.7.x as 8 being just around the corner... it is not)\n",

  "fixes": "\"The term hotfix was originally applied to software patches that were applied to live i.e. still running systems.\"\nI'll probably always be making this apology, but here goes... sorry for the lateness of these notes! While the content team was cranking on the next big update our coders (myself included) were chasing crashes and offline contact bugs. Things are starting to calm to a pleasant 'blistering insanity' level of urgency. Here is a list of all the ninja updates we did this week. Can't thank you guys enough for your patience with us as we smash our match-making and chased those loot-devouring crash bugs.\n-Fixed a long-standing memory corruption bug that was the cause of many random crashes.\n-Mod drop levels determined by enemy killed not your inventory. No more farming Mercury for level 30 Mods.\n-Foundry enforced player level requirements. Fix checks for unranked players.\n-Minimap rendering changed to use navigation mesh. Necessary for upcoming environment. Work-in-progress...\n-Preliminary in-game update message when updates are pushed (working on getting this to sync better with our CDN).\n-Hardware failure check to detect problems due to faulty RAM, overclocking instability, heat problems.\n-Signin rewards UI shows required days to reach tiers.\n-Added fallbacks when trying to join a session that ends while joining.\n-Fix chosen Artifacts cards not showing promptly in Front-end.\n-Fix double cameras after host migration.\n-Fix crashes in AI and animation.\n-Fix Corpus laser door networking issues.\n-Fix over-bloom on characters.\n-Fix for doors/elevator problems with join-in-progress.\n-Improvements to prevent accidental selling in Inventory.

Work-in-progress...\n-Fix elemental effects not showing on Scindo, Frago and many crafted Swords and Daggers.\n-Energy pickups are now shared with other players. More energy in Coop!\n-Fixes for Volt overload being over-powered, then under-powered. Does radial damage as well.\n-Fix quit exploits with Alerts.\n-Fix revive from Pause menu.\n-Prevent join-in-progress of late-stage missions.\n-Relax video card restrictions in Launcher.\n-Fix Artifacts not applying with join-in-progress.\n-AI will not incorrectly target Turrets anymore.\n-Update APEX libraries to improve Nvidia PhysX Effects stability.\n-Add help option for chat commands.\n-Fix Shotgun Ammo Pack reward being 0.\n-Fix disarm exploit for some bosses.\n-Fix for Contacts list not working when you have large number of Contacts/Clan members.\n-Additional attack animation for Scindo and Frago\n-Alert enemy levels are now using their region level range.\n-Stamina Mods for Warframes added.\n-Fix Corpus Security Cams being alert when they shouldn't. Work-in-progress...\n-Fix chat window input text being erased as presence changes came in.\n-Fix Warframe Armor Mods being most common type.\n-Disabled non-XInput joystick enumeration that was causing instability.\n-Improvements to 'massive lag' problems caused when a client re-joins a session they had left.\n-Fix \"too many\" Ancients in some missions.\n-Fixes to Mod drop levels / rarity.\n-Crash fixes during update.\n-Rank exploits fixed.\n-Fixed a few cases where setting wouldn't save (illegal characters). Sorry but this one resets your settings.\n-Balance changes for out of control critical damage Mods.\n-Various crash fixes & loc updates\n-Fixed level 1 mods being dropped by higher enemies\n",
